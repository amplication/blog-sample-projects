		"biology": "Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines and provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.\nAs mentioned in the anime, starter Pokémon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers. Having been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur in the anime have demonstrated a nurturing instinct towards younger, weaker Pokémon, one individual even using its vines to pick up a crying Pokémon, gently rocking it back and forth through the air while singing a \"Bulba-by.\"\nIt is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been observed that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.",

The bud on its back has bloomed into a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur has a seed in the center of its flower.\nVenusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pokémon and calms emotions. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day. In the anime, Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur and Ivysaur. This Pokémon is rarely found in the wild, but it has been known to inhabit grasslands.\nAs Mega Venusaur, the flower on its back grows larger and two smaller pink flowers bloom, one on its forehead and one on its rear. Its legs and back have become sturdier to support the extra weight of the flower. Additional leaves with woody stems, which are supported by vines, are also grown around the flower.

It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in its upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame.\nCharizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath is capable of melting boulders and massive glaciers, and has been known to accidentally cause forest fires. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. Charizard typically inhabits mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. The anime has shown that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. It also showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pokémon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. Charizard's wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters). Charizard lives in herds with Charmander.\nCharizard has two Mega Forms. Both feature a shorter snout, white, vertical slit pupils, and a bright underside reaching the lower jaw.\nAs Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane, and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue. It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense flames.\nAs Mega Charizard Y, it becomes sleeker in appearance but retains its normal coloration. It has three pointed horns on the back of its head, the middle of which is longer. Its snout has larger fangs and a ridge on the nose. Its neck is shorter, but its torso is thinner and longer. It features longer digitigrade feet. Its hands are less developed, with extremely shortened fingers that are no longer separated from each other. Small wings develop on its wrists, while the ones on its back become larger, lose the wing finger passing through their membrane and end up with ragged edges. The back of its tail has a large spike at the base and three smaller ones near the tip, which now burns with a longer flame. Mega Charizard Y is said to have incredible flying prowess that is greater than a jet fighter.\nCharizard also has a Gigantamax form. As Gigantamax Charizard, it becomes larger and physically fit. The lower part of its body glows white with several yellow diamonds located on the lower belly. There are also diamond-shaped spots located on the front legs. The claws located on its hands and feet become longer and sharper. The feet become longer and digitigrade, retaining small glowing soles under the forefeet. The sclerae of the eyes become yellow. The glow of a flame can be seen in the mouth, and the teeth grow, with the lower front teeth and three teeth in the middle now protruding when the mouth is closed. The flame on the tail extends out and has three red clouds surrounding it, like the clouds most other Gigantamax Pokémon have. Two flames sprout from its horns, and its wings are transformed into literal flame wings extending to the shoulder blade. These colossal flamed wings were created from the energy of Gigantamaxing, and are hotter than magma; Gigantamax Charizard uses these flames to burn its opponents.[1] The flames within Gigantamax Charizard burn hotter than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,000 degrees Celsius), and increase in temperature when it roars.\nGigantamax Charizard is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Wildfire.",

It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs.\nThe anime has shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In the anime, Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. It has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant. While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.\n In the mouth of CramorantPikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It is able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. Pikachu has been known to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharging fellow Pikachu with electric shocks.

It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. The second form is Pikachu in a cap, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in Generation VII. It is always male and has eight variants, each wearing one of Ash's hats from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. The last, the partner Pikachu, is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender, has higher base stats, and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not.\nAs Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and becomes capable of storing all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Three red clouds float around the tail. Its power is equal to that of a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples' homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.[1]\nPikachu and its variants have several signature moves:\nPikachu and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle.\nPikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika.\nPikachu in a cap is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt.\nThe partner Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, and Splishy Splash, as well as the partner power Pika Papow.\nGigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash.Pikachu is also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Light Ball item.",

Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back are two horizontal brown stripes.

If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up and its muscles become stimulated. However, it will become aggressive if it has stored too much electricity and stress.

This is also thought to be connected to its Psychic abilities.\nAlolan Raichu's origins were initially a mystery at the time. The people of Alola suggested it ate too many sweet and fluffy pancakes,[1] especially those made with a secret Alolan recipe.

Tucked close to its thorax are three pairs of tiny, whitish legs. Its abdomen is paler with several black, zigzagging stripes encircling it. It has two pairs of pale purple moth-like wings with thin black venation.\nVenomoth's wings are covered in dust-like scales that vary in color depending on their toxic capability. Dark scales are poisonous, while lighter scales can cause paralysis. These scales are released when Venomoth flutters its wings and leak out poison once they make contact with the skin. Venomoth lives in dense temperate forests with thick undergrowth and little light. As a nocturnal Pokémon, Venomoth comes out at night to hunt for its favorite prey. It prefers to feed on insects that gather around light sources, and Venomoth is attracted to bright lights itself. As stated in Pokémon Adventures, Venomoth has a short lifespan.",

		"biology": "Diglett is a tiny, brown Pokémon that seems to be perpetually buried within the earth, leaving only its head visible. Its small stature makes it both the lightest and shortest Ground-type. It has beady black eyes and a large, round, pink nose. A Diglett in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team mentions that it has feet, though their size and appearance are unknown. It spends much of its time underground and has very thin skin. If Diglett is exposed to sunlight, its blood will heat up and cause it to grow weak.\nDiglett lives in tunnels and caves under the earth, where it feeds on tree roots and vegetables. It is known to live in burrows left behind by Onix. It also sometimes lives in burrows near forests and has even been shown to live inside of trees. Diglett digs regularly through the earth at a shallow depth, leaving perfectly tilled soil in its wake. Some farmers welcome Diglett because it tills their fields and its droppings enrich the soil, but others consider it a pest for eating their vegetables. In Generation II, Fissure was its signature move.\nIn Alola, Diglett has developed three fine gold whiskers on its head from living in soil with high iron content. These whiskers function as sensors and allow it to monitor its surroundings without coming above ground, though it will still occasionally poke its head out to see outside. The whiskers can also be used for communication, wobbling around to relay mood or emotion. They stand straight up for anger, swing around for happiness, and droop for sadness.[1] Needing to be able to dig through Alola's volcanic rock, Alolan Diglett is notably stronger than its non-Alolan counterparts. However, they are still very small, tying with Klefki and Meltan as the shortest Steel-type.\nDespite Diglett having a strong resemblance to Wiglett from the Paldea region, the two Pokémon species are not biologically related, having entirely separate diets and habitats.[2] Their resemblance to each other is said to be a coincidental result of adaptations to their respective environments.[3]",

Each head is incredibly tough with a smooth surface, and has brown skin, black eyes, and a large, round, pink nose. Dugtrio's three heads think the same thoughts and act cooperatively, though on rare occasions may fight over which head gets to eat first. In order to make burrowing easier, each head will bob up and down to loosen the soil. Dugtrio can tunnel under the earth at 60 mph (100 km/h) to a depth of 60 miles (100 kilometers), triggering tremors and earthquakes. It is capable of burrowing endlessly. Dugtrio lives in tunnels and caves under the earth. Dugtrio is considered important for agriculture as its digging aerates the soil and makes it suitable for farming. As shown in the anime, Dugtrio sometimes lives in hollow trees in forests. It maintains the soil and plants trees to revitalize wooded areas. In Generation II, Fissure was its signature move.\nAlolan Dugtrio is nearly identical to its counterpart, except each head has a mop of golden hair formed from modified whiskers. The left head has a bob-cut, the right head has curly \"shoulder-length\" hair, and the last one has flowing hair that touches the ground behind it. This hair is made out of thin, yet heavy strands of steel, which grows slowly and continuously throughout Alolan Dugtrio's life.[1] The hairs act as a defensive measure, as well as sensors that can detect vibrations from long distances underground. In the Alola region, Alolan Dugtrio is regarded as a feminine deity of the earth, and taking its hairs is thought to bring bad luck.[1]\nWugtrio was once considered a regional variant of Dugtrio due to their resemblance, but it has since been reclassified as a completely separate species.",

Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold koban coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games almost always depict Meowth on two legs, the anime states that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly.\nMeowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using its signature move, Pay Day. Meowth and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence, with at least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas.\nIn Alola, Meowth has a slightly different look. Alolan Meowth's fur is a light blue-gray color. Instead of brown markings, the tip of its tail, whiskers, digits, and the insides of its ears a whitish-gray. Alolan Meowth's whiskers have a slight curve compared to regular Meowth's straighter whiskers, and it has silvery eyes.\nMeowth was introduced to Alola as a gift to royalty.[1] The luxurious royal lifestyle soon led to Meowth diverging from its origins and becoming the selfish, prideful, and cunning Alolan Meowth. Alolan Meowth will turn hysterical if its coin or pride are besmirched. When the monarchy fell, the rare Alolan Meowth went feral and eventually grew as common in Alola as anywhere else.\nGalarian Meowth has a shaggy, greyish-brown coat resembling a beard, as well as yellow eyes and a toothy grin. Its coin is now black and extremely hard, with the darkest and hardest coins being especially valued and respected among the species. Galarian Meowth's body has partially turned to iron as a result of many years of living with a race of savage seafarers. As a result of many battles, Galarian Meowth develops the ability to evolve into Perrserker, instead of Persian. Kantonian Meowth and Galarian Meowth don't get along.\nSome Kantonian Meowth are capable of Gigantamaxing. As Gigantamax Meowth, it has become larger and longer in size. The body extends from the lower half to the shoulder, while the gold coin gains a symbol. Meowth's eyes change to a glowing gold color. The tail grows long as well, with the end of it tips extending. The tail gets even larger and bumpy when it uses an attack. Three red clouds surround it below the shoulders.\nThe giant coin on Gigantamax Meowth's head emits a lot of Gigantamax power that surrounds the area with a golden gleam. Its desire for shiny objects increases to the point where it will cause damage to skyscraper windows and exterior walls for the sake of sharpening its claws.[2] The symbol on Gigantamax Meowth's gold coin is believed to be the key to unlocking the secrets of Dynamax.\nGigantamax Meowth is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Gold Rush.",

Its thick whiskers are very sensitive to changes in air movements, enabling it to detect its prey by movement alone. In the center of its forehead is a red jewel. Its long tail has a distinctive curl at the end. Persian communicates with body language and holds its tail upright to signal its intention to pounce. It has long legs and three-toed paws with retractable claws. Persian's lithe muscles also enable it to walk without making a sound.\nPersian normally lives in towns and cities. Although popular for its elegance, it is extremely difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality. It will scratch anyone, including its Trainer, with little or no provocation, and has been observed ripping its prey apart for no discernible reason. However, when Persian is yanked by its whiskers, it becomes temporarily docile for unknown reasons. It is popular among rich people and is targeted by hunters for its jewel. Its relationship with Perrserker is one of mutual disdain, as Persian's refined and elegant personality clashes with Perrserker's barbaric nature.\nAlolan Persian has a body that is similar to its regular counterpart, but it has blue-gray fur.

Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. Slowpoke tails are considered a delicacy and commonly used as a cooking ingredient: in Alola, they are often dried and used in home-cooked stews, while in Galar, they are smoked and packaged as a curry ingredient. Slowpoke is also known to dive underwater to hunt, but is often itself caught instead.\nSlowpoke has a notoriously dim intellect and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water's edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke's yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas. Its vacant expression is said to help some people relax, whilst causing irritation to others. It is posited that those who lead hectic lives are most likely to become relaxed.\nGalarian  Slowpoke's body is a slightly different shade of pink, and it has gained yellow colorations on its forehead and tail. This tail is always down and said to have a spicy taste. Much like its Kantonian counterpart, Galarian Slowpoke are known to relax on seashores and riverbanks without a care in the world. However, sometimes it will get a very sharp look in its eyes as if it is about to think of something tremendous, although it will quickly forget and return to its normal expression afterward. It is believed that this behavior, along with the spicy taste of its tail, is a result of Galarica particles built up from its diet of native Galarica seeds affecting its brain and body.[1] This diet also affects Slowpoke's two different evolutions, including the Shellder that attaches to it, which is induced by either the Galarica Cuff or the Galarica Wreath.",

		"biology": "Slowbro is a bipedal, pink Pokémon with a tan, striped belly and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has large, vacant eyes, curled ears, and two small pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers on its hands and two clawed toes on its feet. There is a Shellder attached to its tail. This Shellder has a gray, spiral shell with darker gray spots and small, triangular eyes near the base. There are several spikes across the surface of the Shellder, and it holds onto Slowbro with many sharp teeth. Shellder developed its spiral form in an effort to suck more sweetness out of Slowbro's tail. If its tail or the Shellder attached to it is broken off, Slowbro will revert to its unevolved form, Slowpoke.\nSlowbro has lost the capability to feel pain due to the Shellder's poison. While typically lazy and unintelligent, Slowbro apparently becomes inspired when the Shellder bites down on its tail. While it is capable of unleashing powerful psychic attacks, Slowbro is typically rather peaceful and usually prefers not to fight. Because it can no longer fish using its tail, it instead swims to catch its prey and allows the Shellder to feed on its leftover scraps. Slowbro tends to live near ponds, lakes, and seashores.\nWhen Slowbro Mega Evolves, it becomes engulfed by the Shellder so that only its head, arms, and white-tipped tail are visible. Its head pokes out of the Shellder's mouth and is surrounded by the Shellder's enlarged teeth. The Shellder has holes on its sides and an opening at its tip, allowing Mega Slowbro's arms and tail to stick out. Mega Slowbro balances on its tail due to its legs being engulfed. It can move by bouncing, using its tail as a spring. The spikes on the Shellder are now reduced to four on the bottom section of its body and the dark spots only visible on its middle section. Mega Slowbro's energy has gathered into Shellder, which has increased its hardness. This allows it to act as armor so hard that nothing can scratch it. The Slowbro inside is virtually unchanged, but it gains some power and motivation from Shellder's digestive fluids.\nIn Galar, Galarian Slowbro's appearance is due to Shellder biting Galarian Slowpoke's arm instead of its tail, causing a chemical reaction between the Shellder's poison and the consumed Galarica spices within the Slowpoke's body.[1] The Shellder attached to its arm resembles the Shellder tail of its Kantonian counterpart but smaller, with a purple tip shaped like a stinger. Galarian Slowbro itself has a slight color difference compared to its counterpart, with purple accents on its head, arms and tail.\nGalarian Slowbro are considered highly dangerous for its tendency to indiscriminately attack its surroundings, the reason for which is due to its Shellder sometimes unconsciously biting down hard on its arm. While normally zoned out, when facing a strong opponent its body becomes stimulated, and it will sport a sharper expression. Galarian Slowbro attacks by grabbing at its Shellder's tongue, causing the Shellder to fire poisonous liquids from its tip. It attacks at speeds rivaling the quickest of known reflexes.[1]\nGalarian Slowbro is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shell Side Arm. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Quick Draw as an Ability.",

		"biology": "Magnemite is a seemingly robotic Pokémon that has a gray, spherical metal body, with blue-and-red tipped horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, the anime has shown that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. It has even exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrients is electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph. It has also been present in AZ's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.\nThe magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, it has been demonstrated that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again.\nMagnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Pokétch. It has even been shown to be attracted to electric Pokémon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off.",

		"biology": "Magneton splitting into three MagnemiteMagneton is a robot-like Pokémon, the result of three Magnemite becoming linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when there are no other Magnemite in the vicinity. Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pokémon Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6°F (2°C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (1,000 meters). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area.\nBeing composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still has the need to eat. As seen in the anime, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants. When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in Pokémon Adventures, it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph, and one was shown in a flashback to the great war of Kalos, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago.",

It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead (similar to a unibrow), and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.\nFarfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life. Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things. There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as the anime and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the Farfetch'd population.\nIn Galar, Farfetch'd has a slightly different look. Galarian Farfetch'd is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head. The leek it carries with its wings is much larger in Galar than the leeks that Farfetch'd use in other regions, although whether it is related to the Large Leek used as a curry ingredient is unknown.\nGalarian Farfetch'd's body has developed a much stronger frame that gives it the strength required to carry its leek. However, this sheer mass makes it hard for it to fly. It is renowned for its courage in battle and can use its leek like swords or javelins. As a result of surviving and experiencing many different battles, Galarian Farfetch'd develops the ability to evolve into Sirfetch'd.\nFarfetch'd and its Galarian evolved form are the only known Pokémon capable of using the Leek item.",

Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs.\nEach head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking.\nAlong with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well.

Its purple sludge body contains a variety of pungent bacteria, which are so potent that it renders soil barren and incapable of supporting plant life. It is constantly oozing a bacteria-rich fluid from all parts of its body. Should it run out of internal germs, Grimer will die. Pieces of it often break off during travel and go on to become new Grimer. When combined with another Grimer, it produces new poisonous compounds.\nDue to its lack of a solid form, Grimer is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease. It uses this to penetrate sewage pipes and feed off of the filthy wastewater inside. Its population fluctuates based on the availability of waste, which is Grimer's main diet. It can be found in polluted lakes and streams, as well as within cities and factories where trash and industrial waste can be found. In recent years, thanks to efforts in environmental improvements and a decrease in their food source of waste, Grimer is now facing extinction.\nGrimer was brought to Alola to deal with the excess waste generated by the region's increased population.

Its enormously long red tongue is used to burrow itself into the sand to sleep overnight and also to lure and capture prey. The tongue protrudes even when its shell is closed and tugging it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way.\nShellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokémon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar, Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian  Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths, causing the evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively.\nRegardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell.\nWhile in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokémon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body.\nPrior to Generation III, Clamp was its signature move. In Generations III and IV, Icicle Spear was its signature move. Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell.

Its shell is harder than a diamond with spikes that are even harder; harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes. On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth. Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen. Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside.

Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them.\nIt produces a faint, sweet smell. The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and it is capable of enshrouding an enemy of any size. Gastly's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence. The anime suggests that Gastly has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun. However, it has shown a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans. It has further been shown changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses. Gastly can be found within caves and old, dilapidated buildings, but may also be seen outdoors during nighttime. Its gaseous body will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so they huddle together in decent-sized groups under house eaves to avoid the wind. It may also cause flickering lights in abandoned houses. In Generation I, Night Shade was its signature move.",

It also has a stubby tail.\nGengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar's body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10°F (5°C), because it absorbs the warmth. The anime has shown that Gengar can fly, possess people and other Pokémon, and extend its tongue by several meters. In Generation I, Night Shade was its signature move.\n Gengar in Ash's shadowGengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one's shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim's terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night.\nAs Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish-purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions.[1] The spikes on Mega Gengar's back are more numerous and pointed, and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.\nMega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no interest in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to Mega Evolution. It now desires to take and curse the life of anyone or anything in its path; it may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.\nAs Gigantamax Gengar, it becomes larger, with portions of its body sinking into the ground, and only the head, tail, and arms remain. Its body changes from dark-purple to light-purple and its eyes become white with yellow sclera. The inside of its mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tongue sticking out. Three red clouds surround the top of Gengar's head.\nGigantamax Gengar's mouth is rumored to not lead into its body. Due to the cursed energy, it is believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it attempts to steal the lives of those it captures.

Inside its brain is a magnet that serves as an internal compass, guiding Onix wherever they need to go and prevents them from getting lost while digging.\nOnix tunnels under the ground at over 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, which causes tremors and a terrifying roar that echoes a long way. Hard objects encountered while tunneling are absorbed into its body, which makes it very sturdy. It also consumes the boulders for food. The massive, winding tunnels it leaves behind are used as homes by Diglett. As seen in the Pokémon Stadium series, Onix is capable of rotating its head, or any part of its body, in a full 360 degrees. It is a very aggressive Pokémon that will constantly attack humans and other Pokémon when in pain, as seen in the anime. As seen in the Pokémon Adventures manga, Onix can be separated from its body segments in battle and be fine later on, either regenerating or reattaching to its body segments.

Because of its resemblance to Poké Balls, it is thought that it was created when one was exposed to an energy pulse.\nThis is supported by the fact that its components do not occur naturally. Voltorb is generally found in power plants and other areas with electric fields where it feeds. It was first discovered in the plant where modern Poké Balls were invented. It has a volatile temperament and will explode if agitated or bumped by the slightest contact. Due to being constantly mistaken as a Poké Ball, Voltorb has reportedly zapped many humans as a result.\nHisuian Voltorb, like their modern counterparts, resemble the Poké Balls of the time period (made from Apricorns), having the same wood grain pattern and a hole on top, from which it discharges all of its stored electricity while lacking the latch. On the inside, they contain numerous seeds, but it has been impossible to examine their interior due it being pitch-black. Hisuian Voltorb has a distinctive red wooden unibrow.\nUnlike Kantonian Voltorb, they have friendly and excitable temperaments, which leads them to cluster around people, causing them to be a nuisance when they discharge. It is known to let out a great, uproarious laugh whenever it discharges. Hisuian Voltorb can store electric currents in its belly.

As a result, it often causes blackouts. The more electric energy Electrode consumes, the faster it moves. Electrode explodes in response to even the smallest stimulation, simply to entertain itself, or because it has taken in too much electricity. But unlike Voltorb, Electrode can control its explosive ability at will. When full of stored electricity, it has been known to drift with the wind. Electrobe is known as the Bomb Ball due to being high feared because of its explosive nature.\nIn Hisui, Electrode also resembles the upside-down Poké Balls of the time period, with a wooden pattern on its top half.

It has thin, green leaves sprouting from the top of its body. Exeggutor has three round, light yellow heads that resemble coconuts, each with different facial expressions.\nExeggutor's heads think independently and don't appear interested in one another, so it makes a lot of noise as each head speaks its mind. They still appear to get along, though, for they never squabble amongst themselves. If all the heads want to go in a different direction, its body is unable to move.

However, its neck can also be a weak point as it will become dizzy swinging it around. Its increased height reduced its need for a psychic defense and has instead awakened its draconic powers, resulting in its psychic powers becoming weaker.

Primarily brown, it has cream-colored, segmented arms and legs. Each hand has three fingers and each foot has three clawed toes. The soles of its feet and its ankles have circular, yellow pads. Hitmonlee is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart.\nHitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring (and one particular Hitmonlee has the ability to do this with its arms as well). This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides and gives it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. Hitmonlee's kicking strength is incredibly powerful owing to its diamond-like soles. It has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Kick Master\". After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rare in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas.\nHitmonlee has had a number of kicking moves as signature moves:\nHigh Jump Kick (Prior to Generation III)\nJump Kick (Prior to Generation IV)\nRolling Kick (Prior to Generation VII)\nMega Kick (In Generation II, and from Generation IV to VI)",

There is a yellow spot on its palms and the soles of its feet. It has beady eyes and a long, prehensile tongue, with nerves that extend its entire length. The tongue is likely connected to its tail, which twitches and retracts when the tongue is pulled.\nAt over 6 feet 6 inches (2 meters), Lickitung's tongue is twice as long as its body. Sticky, smelly saliva coats its tongue, which causes a tingling sensation when touched and can cause rashes if not cleaned off. It is used for capturing prey (mainly Bug-type Pokémon), exploring its environment, attacking, and cleaning; although the effectiveness of its cleaning is questionable as its saliva leaves behind its smell. Lickitung's saliva can also be used as a strong adhesive after cooking it. Lickitung remembers things by their texture and taste, although it apparently dislikes sour things. The tongue is both dexterous and powerful enough to lift people, as seen in the anime. When capturing prey, Lickitung prefers swallowing them whole after paralyzing them with its tongue.

The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.\nEach of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.\nWeezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing's body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantonian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.\nIn the Galar region, its appearance has changed due to absorbing polluted air from factories. It has a gray body with the skull, crossbones, and ring patterns changed to the color yellow. Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly releases purified air. Five puffs of green poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it. The gas clouds also partly cover its faces: the larger head has a mustache-like cloud on its upper lip, while the smaller head has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard.\nGalarian Weezing consumes particles from polluted air, and expels clean air instead of droppings. The toxins within Galarian Weezing's body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leaks and drifts around it. The gas is its best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff.[1] Galarian Weezing preys on Trubbish for the fumes it produces.\nBoth forms of Weezing, along with its pre-evolution, Koffing, are the only known Pokémon that can have Neutralizing Gas as an Ability.

Female Scyther have larger abdomens than male Scyther. Its reptilian head has two narrow, triangular eyes and three blunt horns extending from its forehead. Its arms end in large, white scythes, which it uses for both hunting and fighting. Two pairs of cream-colored wings extend from its back. While these wings do allow Scyther to fly, it rarely does so. Scyther's thighs have large, upward-pointing spikes. Its feet are tall, rounded, and conical, almost extending to its thighs; each foot ends in three small, white claws on its front side.\nScyther is an adept hunter that tears at its prey with its scythes. Thanks to its green coloration, it can camouflage itself well in the grasslands and forests where it lives. Humans rarely encounter wild Scyther in these areas, however. Said to be like a ninja, Scyther can move so quickly that it cannot be followed, increasing the effectiveness of its scythes. It maintains the sharpness of its blades through battle as well as by cutting through hard objects, such as trees; it can cut down a massive tree with just a single slice, although it cannot penetrate Tarountula's elastic threads. The anime has shown that wild Scyther form swarms with a single leader chosen through combat. When a challenger successfully defeats a current leader and replaces it, the defeated leader is exiled from the swarm. It has also been shown that Scyther becomes aggressive when faced with the color red.",

However, this language has yet to be deciphered. It prefers to communicate by using dance-like movements. There are some musicians who compose songs for Jynx to sing. These rhythmic movements often cause people to dance along with it. The Jynx in Alola are said to have wonderful precise movements. In certain parts of Galar, it has been feared and worshiped while being called the \"Queen of Ice\". The Jynx in Galar are said to have beautiful and delicate voices and a fanbase dedicated to them.

There is a large, lightning bolt-shaped stripe on Electabuzz's chest, a V-shaped stripe on its forehead, one stripe on its side, a thick stripe down its back, two bands on each leg, several broken bands on each arm, and many rings around its long tail. There are three clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, and five fingers on each hand.\nIn the dark, Electabuzz will glow light blue from the electrical charges running across its body. It is constantly leaking more electricity than it consumes. Electabuzz often gathered groups around tall trees in order to wait for the upcoming storm. During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning in order to absorb the electric power. Electabuzz is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when in close proximity to another of its species. Blackouts have been known to happen when groups of Electabuzz gather to consume electricity of power plants, thus often gets blamed for the occurring power outages. As a result, Ground-type Pokémon are kept around power plants to keep Electabuzz from raiding, although the blackouts are usually the fault of the electric companies, not Electabuzz.\nAs demonstrated in the anime, Electabuzz is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime.

Capable of seeing color to some degree, Pinsir appears to be attracted to the color green. Its legs are short and thick, while its arms are long and thin. It has three claws on each hand and foot; two of its toes face forward and one backward.\nPinsir can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents; lift things twice its weight; and shatter logs. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns and will not be released until they are torn in half. In addition to hunting prey, the anime has shown that it enjoys tree sap. Pinsir lives deep in the temperate forests and jungles, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. In Alola, it has a rivalry with Vikavolt and gets along with Heracross. Pinsir are known to judge each other based on their pincers. The pincers determine its popularity with the opposite gender based on how more thick and impressive it looks.\nAs Mega Pinsir, it gains a large pair of clear, yellow wings with an area of orange venation near the base. Additionally, a set of brown elytra appear. Slicing through each elytron is a pair of orange blades. Its arms become longer and it has a T-shaped spike on each forearm.

It has a rounded muzzle with a dark brown nose, small, triangular eyes, three gray bumps running vertically down its forehead, and a pair of curved, gray horns growing from atop its head. Each of its three black tails has a tuft of fur on the end, and there is a single gray hoof on each foot. Tauros is a male-only species.\nTauros is a violent, rowdy Pokémon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails. It serves as a warning to others that Tauros is about to charge with astonishing speed. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. It lives and travels in herds on plains and grasslands. It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns. While still ferocious, Tauros are calmer in Alola than elsewhere, likely due to the region's climate. The practice of riding Tauros is believed to have started in Alola. However, Tauros in Galar are more volatile and don't want to be ridden. A Tauros's herd protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns.\nIn Paldea, Tauros has a similar appearance to its Kantonian counterpart. All three forms of Paldean Tauros are covered in black fur, a thick black mane, dark gray hooves, and black tail. It has two grey bumps, one small and one big, running vertically on its forehead. The Blaze Breed is exclusive to Pokémon Scarlet, while the Aqua Breed is exclusive to Pokémon Violet. The main difference between the forms is the horns, mane, and tail. The Combat Breed has two straight grey horns, a thick black mane, and shorter black tufts on its tail compared to Kantonian Tauros. Blaze Breed has two grey curved horns pointing forward, a thick spiky black mane with red lines, and three short tufts intertwined to the tails. The Aqua Breed has curved horns pointed up, a black mane with five blue lines shaped like a beard, and three tufts attached to three bended tails connected to one tail.\nCombat Breed Tauros is known for its thick, powerful muscles and aggressive nature. Thanks to its muscular body, Tauros is skilled at close-quarters combat. It uses its horns to strike at an opponent's weak spot.\nBlaze Breed Tauros earns its name from the hot air it breathes from its nostrils. When channeling its energy, the horns of Tauros can reach a temperature of 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. Anyone gored by Blaze Breed Tauros's horns will suffer both wounds and burns.\nAqua Breed Tauros is recognized for its high body fat, which allows it to float easily in the water.

Its pectoral and tail fins are white. On its back is a stiff, three-peaked yellow fin, resembling a crown; there is an identical fin on its underside. It also has long barbels. The barbels are white on a female and pale-yellow on a male. A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species.\nMagikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. In Generation I, Splash was its signature move. It is often seen using Splash to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as Pidgeotto and Pidgeot. Frillish is also known to prey on Magikarp.\nIn Hoppy Town, there are at least 31 unique pattern varieties of Magikarp, with their scales coming in colors such as gray, black, white, purple, pink, violet, apricot, and brown. These patterns can be classified by groups, depending on how the Magikarp looks while it is still small; a specific pattern arises when it becomes bigger. Which patterns can be caught depend on the type of Old Rod; the better the rod, the more groups of patterns can be fished.

It has one barbel and a small white fin on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female and blue on a male. It has small, red eyes, a three-pointed, dark blue crest on its head, and four white, spiky dorsal fins. Gyarados's tail fin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points.\nThe process of evolution causes a change in its brain structure that is believed to cause its violent nature. Gyarados's fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies since ancient times. In some regions, Gyarados is called the \"deity of destruction\" because of this. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. These rampages can occur even during a harsh storm. A Gyarados's rage won't stop completely until everything is destroyed. Some believed any human settlement is fated to be destroyed should a Gyarados appear. Gyarados lives in both fresh and salty waters. Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in the anime that it can leap huge distances both from the water and from the ground, usually several times its own body length. However, Gyarados is rarely seen in the wild. The move Hyper Beam is often associated with Gyarados due to it being being powerful enough to instantly destroy everything it hits.\nWhen it Mega Evolves, Gyarados becomes bulkier.

Most of the other fins along its back disappear, replaced by two rows of blue spikes. There are now four yellowish, spiky fins near its tail: two on its back and two on its underside.\nDue the stress Mega Evolution puts on a Gyarados's body, it becomes even more ferocious than before. All other brain functions cease when Mega Evolution occurs, except for the destructive drive to burn down anything into cinders. Despite its brain having a powerful destructive instinct, it will obey a Trainer it truly trusts. Mega Gyarados can launch at Mach Speed by using its orifices to release water from both sides.

It has a pink, polyhedral head that ends in a blue beak and has hexagonal eyes, and it has a pink polyhedral body with a blue front, blue triangular prism feet, and a blue rectangular prism tail. In 3D games, such as Pokémon Stadium, it can open its beak and can detach its limbs and head from its torso. According to its Pokédex entries, it has copy protection built into its code, preventing duplication through electronic means. It was created in 1995 by Silph Co.,[1] however documents at Silph Co. claim it was created at the Pokémon Lab on Cinnabar Island using the state-of-the-art technology of its time. Because it was created decades ago, many of its parts have since become obsolete. It was the first artificial Pokémon to have ever been created through computer programming. In ancient Hisui, people were confused about Porygon and its evolutions due to them arriving through space time distortions and having no advanced technology.\nDue to its man-made origins, Porygon does not need to breathe or eat, though it can still accept food if given. It has the ability to convert its body into digital data, allowing it to travel through cyberspace. Recently, it has become more helpful inside cyberspace by searching for any suspicious data that exists. Some believed Porygon has the power to potentially travel in space despite the species not displaying that ability yet. Because it is man-made, it is generally found in computers or in labs and other buildings where people work.\nPorygon and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2. Prior to Generation V, Sharpen was also one of its signature moves. It can use Conversion to change its appearance to mimic another Pokémon's, and has also demonstrated the ability to change color for camouflage.",

There is a hump-like ridge with a spike on its back, and it has a strong tail with an arrow-shaped tip. Its talon-like feet have two toes in front and one in the back, and are capable of scooping up and tightly clutching its prey in flight.\nAerodactyl's serrated saw-like fangs and ferocious attitude were very imposing in its time. Its fangs can rip out throats and tear through the skin of any Pokémon to pieces, even Steel-type Pokémon. By spreading its wings, Aerodactyl is believed to have flown by gliding through the skies, freely letting out its high-pitched cries. However, it is slow to walk on land. It liked to nest in the mountains, where it enjoyed both safety and seclusion. Aerodactyl lived in prehistoric times, and was theorized to become extinct thanks to a giant meteor impact. It was restored in modern times using genetic material extracted from amber; some casualties occurred during these attempts. Even still, this restoration is not considered perfect.\nThe power of Mega Evolution allows some of Aerodactyl's dormant genes to reawaken. As Mega Aerodactyl, its eyes turn bright green and parts of its body turn to stone, which some researchers believe to be its original appearance before fossilization.

The spike on its back and its rear talons have also become black and stony. Rocky plates cover its eyebrows and the corners of its jaw. Similar stone ornaments are present on its chest on its torso: two small ridges flanking a longer ridge. The rocks on Mega Aerodactyl's body are harder than diamond.

It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb.\nMewtwo was created after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments based on Mew. It is widely known as one of the most powerful Pokémon in existence and is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokémon, lacking compassion and striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. In the first movie, where it was shown to be capable of levitation, telepathy, mind control, and the ability to create powerful storms, Mewtwo exemplified these vicious characteristics. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. Another Mewtwo in the anime shared its aversion to contact with others but was much less belligerent.

Its muscles are augmented with psychic power, giving it a grip strength of one ton and the ability to sprint 100 meters in two seconds. When using moves in battle, it is shown to be able to stretch its arms and legs.\nMega Mewtwo Y is smaller and lighter, losing its long tail and the tube behind its neck. However, it grows a long, purple appendage with a curled tip from the back of its head that is similar to its previous form's tail. On its head, it has two pointed, backward-curving spikes and a half-ring structure connecting to the base of each and crossing over the top of its head. Its eyes are now red and slightly larger. The digits on its hands and feet are now purple and more bulbous and the middle toe is longer than the others.

It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope. Mew is said to have the DNA of every single Pokémon contained within its body, allowing Mew to learn and use any attack.\nAs demonstrated by its behavior in the first and eighth Pokémon movies, it shows signs of intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness. Mew is incredibly adaptable, able to travel freely in the air or underwater. As seen in Pokémon Snap and the Super Smash Bros. series, it can create a green, yellow, or pink orb of energy around itself for protection, although only the pink orb is seen in the latter.\nAccording to the radio drama, The Birth of Mewtwo, Mew was discovered by Jessie's mother, Miyamoto, who registered its cry in Guayana Forest 20 years before the events of Generation I. It was worshiped for its protection by indigenous people who created a folk song in its honor and believed it appeared once a year with the rising sun. It wasn't rediscovered until 18 years after Miyamoto met Mew by sunrise on the peak of the highest mountain in a South American mountain range and fell.\nReports found in Cinnabar Island's Pokémon Mansion note scientific expeditions that have sighted Mew in Guyana, South America, the place where it was first discovered.

It is usually found in groups and often touch tails with other Pichu as a show of courage, creating a shower of sparks that can make them cry. It is inept at storing electricity and may discharge if amused, startled, or subjected to shock. However, it cannot discharge without being shocked itself. Charging up is more easily done on days of dryness or with thunderclouds. The crackling of static electricity generated by Pichu is audible. It can zap an adult human but will surprise itself if it does. Pichu primarily lives in the forest, though it has also been depicted to thrive in urban areas.\nPichu has an alternate form called Spiky-eared Pichu that appeared in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, as well as the anime and the manga.

It has purple, branching gills on either side of its head; the males have more branches in its gills than the females. Wooper stands on two small, round feet, and it has a large, thick tail. On its belly are dark blue curved markings.\nIt is implied in the anime that Wooper is a dull-witted Pokémon oblivious to its surroundings. Wooper lives in cold water most of the time. When sleeping, it partially buries itself in the mud at the bottom. It will occasionally leave the water when the air cools in the evening to search for food along the shore. While walking on land, it coats its body with a slimy, toxic film that keeps its skin from dehydrating and insulates against the cold. The film causes a shooting pain if touched barehanded. It is a timid Pokémon and tends to stay close to Quagsire. Arbok is a natural predator of Wooper.\nWooper in the Paldea region has a brown coloration, with two pairs of bone-shaped gills branching from its head, as well as an eight-pronged pattern on its stomach. Paldean Wooper once lived in the water during ancient times until they were forced out of their territory. As a result, they gradually adapted to living on land, namely in marshes. Paldean Wooper employs two adaptations to allow it to survive on land: its gills have hardened, and it coats its body with a poisonous film that keeps it from drying out. However, these adaptations resulted in Paldean Wooper having heavy bodies and being only able to move really slowly. To defend itself, Paldean Wooper can use its gills to unleash a powerful poisonous liquid.[1] Paldean Wooper travel and work together in groups of three or four, and enlist the help of their evolutionary relative, Clodsire, to ferry them across water. Despite the adaptational change, Paldean Wooper can still float or swim in the water.",

Quagsire's hands and feet both have three digits. Its outer layer of skin is slimy and slippery.\nQuagsire is carefree and sluggish by nature, although it is protective towards Wooper. An unintelligent Pokémon, it tends to bump its head inadvertently while swimming and seems not to care. It hunts for food by leaving its mouth wide open in water and waiting for its unaware prey to blunder in. Because Quagsire does not move, it does not get very hungry and can afford to wait for its food. Quagsire lives in clean bodies of freshwater, as well as muddy swamps. During the day, Quagsire avoids sunlight by submerging itself in the water.\nIn the anime, wild Quagsire are shown to have an annual celebration at Blue Moon Falls when the moon is full.

Its feet and hands each have a single clawed digit, while the hands also have a clawless thumb. Around its neck is a spiny ruff with alternating red and white stripes. The Shellder on its head has a spiral shape with two horns near the base. A red gem resides in the center of the Shellder. The Shellder's eyes are visible on the back of the Shellder.\nShellder's bite releases venom into Slowpoke's brain, causing a chemical chain-reaction that unlocks a superior intelligence and extraordinary power. More venom is injected into Slowking every time it yawns. The more venom the Shellder releases, the more intelligent Slowking will become. However, if the Shellder on its head comes off, it will forget everything it has learned and would revert itself back to Slowpoke. Slowking's intelligence can match that of a human and it constantly attempts to learn more. Its inspiration and intuition are also highly developed, and Slowking is able to stay calm in any situation and plan situations with effective results; this allows Slowking to solve anything. In the games, Slowking's speech is said to be unintelligible; however, in the anime, it can understand and speak the human language.\nAccording to The Complete Pokémon Pocket Guide, it has such an easygoing personality that it is never stressed. Slowking is rarely found in the wild, though it can be found by the water's edge. It has been seen eating seaweed and drinking coconut milk. In Alola, it is known as \"the sage of the sea\", and it occasionally matches wits with Oranguru by the beach.\nIn Galar, Shellder's bite causes a different chemical reaction in the brain due to the Galarica spices that make up Galarian Slowpoke's diet, causing Galarian Slowking to take on a unique appearance. The tip of its tail and the top half of its body is purple, and it has a long dark cloak that drapes from its neck. The Shellder has grown more dominant, appearing completely different with a rougher texture, a darker gray coloration and a larger size, covering Slowking's eyes and nostrils. It has several purple spots dotting it, with a large one at the center that surrounds a green gem and two black eyes. The spikes on the Shellder are more blunt, and it has two purple horn-like tubes on either side from which poison may be secreted. The Shellder's teeth have also grown in size and are broad and flat instead of sharp; the same holds true for its wearer.\nAs Galarian Slowking evolves, the Shellder on its head has its intelligence skyrocket, giving it the ability to control the Slowking, as well as psychic powers that can rival the power of other Psychic-type Pokémon. Galarian Slowking have been observed chanting mysterious spells and incantations in battle or to communicate with each other. It also chants these spells while creating strange potions using its internal toxins. What these incantations and spells mean have yet to be fully understood.[2]\nSlowking is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Chilly Reception.\nGalarian Slowking is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Eerie Spell, as well as the only known Pokémon that can have Curious Medicine as its Ability.",

It is said that an \"odd power\" emerges when more than one Unown come together.

Its eyes are even with its body and are always seen slanted angrily. Below its eyes are its puffy pink lips. All around its body are sharp, conical spikes, which evolved from scales over time.\nIn order to attack, Qwilfish drinks over 2.6 gallons (10 litres) of water to inflate its body. It then uses the water pressure to shoot poisonous quills at its foe, which can cause fainting. Qwilfish is briefly left defenseless shortly after firing its quills; this is believed by some expert fishers to be the opportune moment to catch this Pokémon. Due to its round body, Qwilfish is not a great swimmer, and when filled with water it is even harder for it to swim. When Qwilfish faces a larger opponent, it will inflate its body to match its size as close as it can.

Its rounded head has three blunt horns extending above its forehead, and eyes with dark yellow pupils. Scizor's thin, black neck connects to a black, teardrop-shaped patch on its thorax. Scizor has broad shoulders and thin, segmented arms ending in large, round pincers, which make up a third of Scizor's body weight. Scizor has a large, rounded abdomen with three black, chevron-shaped stripes extending from its waist down its front; female Scizor have larger abdomens than male Scizor. Scizor's legs are defined by large hip joints, thin thighs, and wide calves, and its feet end in a clawed toe on each side.\nScizor's body and muscles are made of metal that is as hard as steel, with pincers strong enough to crush any hard object. They can be opened and closed like jaws and are patterned with black eyespots with yellow \"pupils\". It will raise its pincers and wave them around to scare off predators or foes, giving it the appearance of having three heads. When it identifies an enemy, Scizor will use its pincers to beat up the opponent to the point there is nothing but scrap left afterwards. Scizor is incapable of flight, instead quickly flapping its wings to regulate its body temperature, in order to prevent itself from becoming too hot and melting. It has tremendous power despite its slim body. Scizor is rarely found in the wild, though it can be found in grasslands. In Generation IX, Bullet Punch is its signature move.\nMega Scizor's pincers lengthen and develop serrations. The lower half of the pincers turn white and gain three-pointed spikes on the underside. The barbs on Mega Scizor's pincers can stab through concrete, and opponents caught in them cannot escape.[1] Its eyespots, along with its actual eyes, are now blue; the former additionally gain a black rim. Additional pieces of black armoring appear on various areas of its body: a three-pointed crest on its forehead and striated coverings on its shoulders and thighs. Mega Scizor's legs are less detailed and resemble large, tapered spikes with white tips.\nWhile Mega Scizor is formidable, it cannot maintain this form for extended periods, as it is overflown with excess energy from its Mega Evolution, and is unable to regulate its body temperature properly. After too long, its body starts to melt, and it loses the strength to wield its heavy pincers.

The ear feather is shorter on the female than on the male. The other ear is short and pointed, and it has narrow red eyes. On its forehead and chest are oval, yellow gem-like protrusions. It has red eyes with black eyelash-like markings on the edges. It has long limbs with two large, white retractable claws on its hands and feet. It is perfectly capable of using its claws to do substantial damage. Its claws are also used for climbing trees in boreal or sub-alpine forests where it lives. It can also bring out its claws to startle foes that attacked it.\nSneasel is a smart, sneaky, and notoriously vicious Pokémon, and blends well into the night in order to ambush their prey. Sneasel feeds on Eggs, such as those of Pidgey, that it steals from unattended nests. It uses its claws to poke a hole in the Egg before slurping the contents out. It has been known to form pairs to hunt: one Sneasel will lure the parents away from their nest, while the other steals their Eggs. Although the Sneasel pair works together, they will also fight over their hunt among themselves. As a result of its Egg-based diet, Sneasel are despised by Breeders to the point where they try to drive away or eradicate the former. Sneasel also preys on Alolan  Sandshrew, but the Sandshrew's skin is so hard that it can cause Sneasel's claws to snap off. Prior to Generation IV, Beat Up was its signature move.\nIn Hisui, Sneasel has a similar appearance to its Johtonian counterpart.

It has been observed that Hisuian Sneasel lacks the spitefulness of its Johtonian counterpart, and it has been theorized that differences in their environments account for the differing personalities.

Prior to Generation IX, Delibird was the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Present by leveling up. Present allows it to carry special items in its tail that may cause damage or heal its opponent. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is its leader. Delibird tends to live in mountainous regions, making its nests over sharp cliffs; notably around Mt. Everest. Iron Bundle shares a resemblance to Delibird and is believed to be a Delibird-based machine built by an ancient civilization.",

However, water can cause Skarmory's hard body to rust easily, so it stays in its nest on rainy days.

The upper half of its mouth is jagged, and when it is open, there are two pointed teeth in its lower jaw. Its feet have three claws and pink paw pads. Its fore feet are cream-colored, but the hind feet are brown. Its brush tail is spiky and bristly.\nZigzagoon is abundantly curious, as it wanders restlessly back and forth while rubbing its nose to the ground in search of something. It always moves in a zigzag fashion, and leaves behind distinct zigzag footprints as it runs. It rubs its bristly back hair against trees to mark its territory and plays dead to fool opponents in battle. The Zigzagoon found outside of Galar are friendlier and calmer compared to their Galarian relatives. Zigzagoon are capable of finding items in the grass or ground, including items that were lost. It is found commonly in grassy fields.\nZigzagoon native to Galar generally look similar to its Hoennian counterpart with a few differences, most notably its black-and-white fur. Its red eyes are surrounded by a black spiked mask-like pattern somewhat resembling stars. Its fore feet are black with white claws, while its hind feet are white with black claws. It has a long pink tongue that is constantly hanging outside of its mouth, between its lower teeth. This Galarian form of Zigzagoon is believed to be the earliest, and thus the original, instance of the species.\nMuch like the Zigzagoon found outside of Galar, Galarian Zigzagoon are known to be constantly on the move and never settling down. It is believed that Galarian Zigzagoon's restless temperament is what originated the zigzag movements observed on both forms of the species. Their known habitat stretches the entirety of Galar, being found in fields, forests, and towns. They enjoy battling to the point where they often attempt to provoke others into fighting them. While this succeeded with other Pokémon, humans instead tend to mistake it as wanting affection, much to the Zigzagoon's frustrations.[1]",

One long stripe stretches the length of its body before ending in an arrowhead shape on its forehead. There are additional stripes on each side of its bushy tail and on its cheeks. It has sharp, elongated claws and small pointed teeth. It has small, tuft-like ears, long cheek fur, and blue eyes.\nLinoone can run up to 60 miles per hour, but it can only run in a straight line, and has to stop before it can make a turn. Because of this behavior, it often fails to catch prey, and struggles on roads that are curving or winding. When it sees prey underwater in ponds, it leaps in and uses its razor-sharp claws to catch and take it down. Linoone's fur is strong and supple, and the shed hairs are used to make high-quality shaving brushes. As shown in the anime, Linoone has an attraction to anything round and will grab any orb-shaped object it sees if given the chance. It often carries a snatched object in its expandable cheek pouches and deposits it in any of a number of secret stashes it keeps on its territory. Linoone tends to live in grasslands.\nGalarian Linoone has a black-and-white color scheme, with longer fur on its ears. Around its red eyes are patterned stripes shaped like a shooting star.

Linoone is known to use its long tongue to taunt opponents. Once the foe is fully enraged, Linoone will hurl itself at them, tackling them by force. These traits make Galarian Linoone very popular among unhappy and angry youths in Galar, who have nowhere to take out their anger and frustrations. By charging at up to 60 miles per hour, it can deliver powerful Tackles and Headbutts with enough destructive force to even knock away a car. Linoone can be thrown off balance should it miss, however.[1] The harsh environments in the Galar region, along with the fierce competition among the species, allows Linoone's survival instincts to improve, leading to the ability to evolve into Obstagoon.[2]",

It has red eyes and a pair of long, black, ear-like extensions on either side of its head. Its legs have a thick covering, resembling a hakama or a pair of pants. Its most notable feature is a pair of large black jaws emerging from the back of its head. These jaws have a yellow, oval-shaped spot on their top surface. They contain ten sharp, metallic teeth - six on the top row and four on the bottom. While the jaws are actually transformed steel horns, Mawile can articulate them at will, using them to bite enemies with enough force to break an iron beam. The jaws also have a long pink tongue. This tongue is incapable of tasting, leading Mawile to use the jaws to eat food it does not like.\nMega Mawile has two sets of jaws protruding from the back of its head, and both sets have a spiky tuft of hair. It also seems to be able to control the jaws independently of one another.[1] The ear-like extensions on its head are longer and have tips with two points. Its legs have grown longer, and its \"pants\" are now magenta. Its arms now resemble thick sleeves, with magenta markings around the wrists.\nMawile is typically found in caves. It uses its non-threatening appearance to make foes underestimate it, then attacks with its giant jaws, sometimes swallowing its prey whole. When engaged in battle, Mawile usually has its back turned to the enemy to make better use of its jaws. Mega Mawile can use both its jaws to grip on prey and tear them apart. These jaws thrash around violently.",

It has black, circular eyes; small tusks protruding from its upper jaw; and small, rounded ears. Its stubby flippers and its underside are both beige.\nWhen it is happy or cheerful, such as when eating in a group, this Pokémon will clap its fins. The mealtimes of Spheal have been described as noisy as a result. Because its body is poorly shaped for swimming and can only walk slowly, it moves primarily by rolling across ice floes. This Pokémon lives in and around the sea. Spheal also lives on any drift ice that comes near the shore in order to avoid predators. Spheal are often juggled by its evolved form Sealeo, which does so to check the former's health. When a Spheal finds prey while drifting at sea, it will inform the Walrein leader of its herd on where to find the prey. Prior to Generation VI, Ice Ball was its signature move.",

Three flat fins protrude from either side of its head, possibly acting in the same manner that a Canard would on an aircraft. It has two pairs of pointed teeth, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Each of its short legs has three claws. Salamence is considered an unusual Pokémon due to the circumstances of its evolution; its fervent desire to fly triggered a cellular mutation that allowed it to suddenly grow large, red wings.\nIts long-held dream fulfilled at last, Salamence constantly flies around and releases intense blasts of fire as an expression of its joy. It only stops flying when it gets exhausted and needs to sleep. If enraged, it loses all sense of self and flies into an uncontrollable rampage, destroying everything around it until it tires itself out. It lives in rough terrain, and it competes with Garchomp midair for food.\nAs Mega Salamence, its wings meld together into a single huge, crescent-shaped wing. According to the anime, the hard, yet very flexible properties of its wings allow them to be used as blades in mid-air battles. Its face, neck, body and tail are narrower, and its tail is noticeably shorter in length. The ridges above its eyes are now far less prominent, and it no longer possesses the thick, gray scaling over its lower jaw. Instead, the smooth red flesh underneath has been left exposed, increasing its streamline appearance. The upper pair of fins resting on the sides of its head are now elongated and tapered.

The translucent parts of its body reveal organ-like structures that glow with a mysterious light; it has a large \"organ\" at the center of its body, two smaller ones aligned with the large oval markings, and two more located in its pectoral fins. In the anime, Primal Kyogre is said to have widened the seas by a large margin simply by taking a swim. Its body matches the composition of sea water, while its skin glows similarly to that of a sapphire.[1]\nKyogre is said to be a powerful Pokémon, having control over the element of water and rain. It is said to have expanded the seas and is hailed as a savior for quenching areas of the world plagued with drought. Kyogre is normally calm and peaceful, but if it meets its rival, Groudon, Kyogre will engage in a cataclysmic battle against it. In the Mystery Dungeon series and core series, Kyogre is able to fly. Kyogre generally lives deep in the ocean and is said to rest in a deep trench.\nKyogre is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Origin Pulse.

Rayquaza has two limbs with three-clawed hands, and two long, flat, horn-like structures on its head, with two shorter horns along its jawline. It has small, yellow eyes with black pupils, prominent pink gums, and two discernible fangs in its upper jaw.\nAs Mega Rayquaza, its body becomes longer and gains more features. Its head becomes longer with the Δ symbol appearing on its forehead. Rayquaza's eyes now contain yellow pupils and red irises, and black, shichishito-shaped markings trail behind its eyes.

Additionally, Jirachi has a normal pair of ovalish eyes on its face, with small, blue triangular markings underneath. On its head is a large, yellow structure with three points extending outward: one from the top and one on either side. On each point is a teal tag, known as a \"wish tag\".

However, it is still capable of fighting while asleep if it is in danger. It awakens for seven days every thousand years, but can also waken if sung to by a voice of purity. During the short periods when it is awake, Jirachi is said to grant wishes. However, in the anime, Jirachi cannot create an object that is desired from a wish. Instead, it teleports the desired object to the person that made the wish. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Jirachi's wishes are granted by writing on the three tags located on its head. Due to only having three tags, Jirachi can only grant three wishes. The anime further reveals that Jirachi's awakening is linked to the Millennium Comet and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy Jirachi needs for hibernation.

The main components that are constant for all four Formes are dominantly a red color, a light blue face, and three light blue dots on its back arranged in a triangle. Typically, there is a purple stripe running down the center of its face and a purple, crystalline organ in its chest. Its white, circular eyes are set inside rectangular, black eye sockets. It is shown in the anime that Deoxys may have a green crystalline organ and facial stripe.\nIn its Normal Forme, Deoxys has tapering legs with a segmented, vertical, blue stripe on the upper portion. The abdomen is black with vertical lines, while the majority of its skin is reddish-orange. The arms are capable of taking different forms, usually a pair of tentacles coiled in a double helix. One tentacle is the primary skin color, while the other is light blue. Alternately, it can form more humanoid arms with a red top and blue underside and a five-fingered hand. This Forme has a blunt protrusion with a single blue stripe on either side of its head and stubby tail.\nWhile in its Attack Forme, Deoxys's legs remain tapered. However, its blue stripes are no longer segmented and run the entire length of the leg and there is now a large spike on the knee. Two pairs of whip-like tentacles with pointed tips, one reddish-orange and one blue, replace its previous coiled, blunted tentacles. The protrusions on its head are now triangular with an additional one extending from the top of its head. Most of its reddish-orange skin has receded, revealing a striated, black chest and abdomen. Finally, its tail is now longer and more pointed.\nDeoxys's Defense Forme has bulky, wide legs that are somewhat flat at the end with a bluish-green spot on each knee. It retains its two pairs of red and blue tentacles, but they are now flat and broad. The head has fused with its body and all protrusions are gone, causing it to resemble a helmet. The reddish-orange skin now covers the entire body, so none of its inner black portions are visible. There is now a single blue stripe on each shoulder, and its tail has disappeared.\nThe Speed Forme of this Pokémon has a sleek black body with thin striation. The reddish-orange skin now covers only its head, hip joints, and the area around its crystal. There is now only one tentacle on each side of its body, one red and one blue. The protrusions on its head now point upward and the back of its head now forms a long spike. There is a long, thick blue stripe running down the center of this longer protrusion. More blue stripes appear on either hip joint and on its legs.\nDeoxys was formed by the mutation of a virus from space. The Pokémon is highly intelligent; its brain appears to be the crystal in its chest. This organ is capable of firing laser beams. As shown in the anime, it is able to regenerate any part of its body that it may have lost during a battle. It has also demonstrated the ability to create an aurora without changing its Forme. These auroras can have different electromagnetic wavelengths and are used to communicate with other Deoxys. It is also shown that the various electromagnetic waves given off by people, Pokémon, and all electronics can obscure its vision if there is enough interference with its communication. This Pokémon came from outer space from inside of a meteor. Deoxys's different forms each possess different abilities and techniques.\nIn the anime and manga, Deoxys has been observed to create clones of itself. These clones have lifeless eyes and duller color, lack of the trademark crystal on the chest, and seem to be unable to change from the Normal Forme. Furthermore, they seem unable to morph their tentacles into hands.

Vespiquen's horns are yellow near its face and black at the tips, and with the gem, they resemble historical headpieces or crowns worn by European royal and noble women in the Late Middle Ages, such as the escoffion.\nSimilar to queen bees in real life, Vespiquen is a female-only species. Vespiquen is the sole queen of a hive of Combee, which it commands by releasing pheromones. The more pheromones Vespiquen produces, the more Combee it will have in its hive. As queen, Vespiquen gives birth to and raises Combee grubs, feeding on flowers to make honey for its progeny; it also controls and protects its hive. It is far more powerful than its Combee, and it will only take direct action if its Combee are unable to protect the hive; even so, the Combee will defend their Vespiquen even to the point of death. Vespiquen will destroy and feed on any outsiders it catches sneaking into its hive. However, if outsiders prove themselves to a Vespiquen by defending its hive, it may repay these acts of kindness with a reward.\nVespiquen is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Attack Order, Defend Order, and Heal Order.",

A female Pachirisu's blue stripe is shorter than a male's. A large white tooth grows out of its mouth. It has deep gray eyes and a yellow circle on each cheek. Its tail is almost twice as big as its body, with three spikes at the top of the curl, which it can use to shoot charges. Though its arms and legs are very short, it can run incredibly fast, enabling it to tire pursuing Pokémon out quickly. It has a great amount of electricity flowing within its body. If it builds up enough charge, it may shock other Pokémon. It is related to the Pikachu line.\nWhen it sleeps, Pachirisu likes to curl its big, fluffy tail round to the front of its body and uses it as a pillow. It also likes to chase and groom its tail. When a Pachirisu sheds its fur it shapes them into furballs, which have static charges just like its fur. It hides its favorite foods—which mainly consist of berries—in these static puffs and stores them in tree holes. It does this to protect the food; if a human or another Pokémon tries to take the food, they will get shocked from the static. It may rub cheek pouches with another Pachirisu to share stored electricity. It is generally found in treetops in forests, as well as the outskirts of a forest and near power plants.",

Both forms also have black oval-shaped eyes, tiny noses, wide yellow lips, and yellow outlines around their eyes and mantles.\nIn the West Sea form, the underside is white and the mantle is pink. The mantle has several small spike-like protrusions on it. On its head is a ring of pink fleshy knobs resembling the gills of a nudibranch. West Sea Shellos's appearance is theorized to have been influenced by warm ocean waters.\nIn the East Sea form, the underside is green and the mantle is blue. The shell has two flap-like protrusions, resembling cerata. These protrusions are lined with yellow. On its head are two white-tipped tentacles resembling rhinophores that extend away from its face. East Sea Shellos's appearance is theorized to have been influenced by cold ocean waters.\nShellos lives along seashores; its color becomes more vibrant the better the waters it lives in is. It can travel onto land, although its skin dries out if it stays on land for too long. If Shellos is pushed or squeezed, a mysterious purple fluid similar to greasy sweat will ooze out of its body. This fluid is its defense mechanism against enemies; although it is harmless, it is very sticky and hard to wash off. Shellos has a friendly disposition, and is said to have great regenerative capabilities. In the anime, West Sea Shellos can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well.\nThis species once had a shell on its back a long time ago, and as such it is considered a close relative to Shellder. The Nurse Joy featured in Gateway to Ruin! revealed Mount Coronet's formation led to an allopatric speciation event, in which the original population of Shellos was separated into two. As a result, Shellos's color and other physical differences began to vary due to environmental differences and population isolation over time. It is also believed that Shellos's diet, which consists of plankton, also influences its form, but this has yet to be proven. The two forms are still able to interbreed; the child takes the mother's form or the father's if bred with a Ditto.

The head, arms, two tail segments, and all four legs are light blue, while the body, tail end, and other two tail segments are a darker shade of blue.\nIt buries itself in sand and lies in wait for unsuspecting prey, gripping it with its tail claws and injecting poison; it will then hold on until the poison takes effect. However, it is capable of surviving for a year without nourishment. Skorupi is related to Sizzlipede through a common ancestor. Skorupi is found in deserts and dry areas like Reversal Mountain, though it can be found in marshy areas such as the Great Marsh. Skorupi is considered a highly dangerous Pokémon due its lethal claws and poison. However, Skorupi cannot stand cold temperatures, becoming weaker when exposed.",

Yanmega is very rare in the wild, though it can be found in wooded and swampy areas. It has very strong jaw power and bites apart its prey's heads while flying at high speed. Yanmega usually aim for the prey's most vulnerable spot, wasting no energy in the process. Yanmega is said to be an extremely violent Pokémon, usually requiring someone of incredible bravery to tame this aggressive bug. When Yanmega needs to rest, it flips its body over and finds a branch to rest on.",

Leafeon's green ears and tail resemble tattered leaves. It has brown eyes and a small, brown nose.\nThis Pokémon's cellular structure is similar to plants, which allows it to perform photosynthesis and purify the air around it by sleeping under the sunlight; it gets its energy in this way instead of eating. It is a pacifistic, quiet Pokémon, preferring not to fight, though it will sharpen its hard, leafy tail for the occasions it needs to. The tail's sharpness is said to exceed that of a master-crafted sword, being able to cut down a large tree with one hit. Leafeon's aroma is similar to fresh grass in its youth; as it ages, this fragrance bears more of a resemblance to fallen leaves. The aroma is favored in Galar, where it is used to create a popular perfume. It lives in lush forests that have clean rivers.",

It is even said to take pride once its prey is fully drained of blood. As shown in Riding the Winds of Change!, Gliscor, along with its unevolved form Gligar, can emit a sort of sound wave in order to detect obstacles and fly around them, similar to echolocation. Its legs appear to be not suitable for walking, so it can only perform short hops when on the ground. Gliscor hangs upside down while sleeping, much like other bat-like Pokémon, and it is nocturnal. It is capable of soundless flight; however, its wings cannot be flapped to the same extent that other Pokémon's wings can. Like Jumpluff and Wingull, Gliscor uses winds and updrafts to glide from place to place. When there is no wind, Gliscor climbs to the top of tall trees using its sharp raptorial claws and then glides from place to place. This practice is similar to flying squirrels.

Instead, the Pokémon began showing highly erratic, unstable behavior and twitchy movements, making it difficult to work with for research. As a result, it is believed the experiment to create Porygon-Z was a failure. This has been attributed to the incompetence of the engineer improperly updating its programming. Academics can't seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true evolution of Porygon2.

In its base form, Rotom cannot be touched by anyone without the latter being electrocuted in the process.\n Rotom and the appliancesRotom has the ability to enter and control appliances. Starting in Platinum, it has five extra forms, which can be accessed by possessing specific household appliances with a special motor, namely: a convection microwave oven (Heat Rotom), a washing machine (Wash Rotom), a refrigerator (Frost Rotom), an electric fan (Fan Rotom), and a lawnmower (Mow Rotom). When Rotom changes form, its eyes and electric aura change colors, and its aura appendages take on different shapes: red with oven mitts as Heat Rotom, blue with clothespins as Wash Rotom, purple with lightning bolts as Frost Rotom, yellow with air curls as Fan Rotom, and green with a ripped strip as Mow Rotom. According to the Rotom Catalog, Rotom in its base form is actually possessing a light bulb.\nRotom's forms were known to have been first discovered and documented by Charon, despite the fact that Rotom existed in Hisui and was also documented in the ancient Hisui Pokédex. The electric fan that Rotom inhabits to become Fan Rotom was invented by a boy, and was the first Rotom-related appliance to be developed, leading to the creation of many other appliances like it. The washing machine model that Rotom can inhabit has been discontinued, which causes its price to skyrocket. Heat Rotom will become lethargic if the oven it possesses is malfunctioning.\nRotom typically use their abilities to make mischief, often using the household items they possess to pull pranks on unsuspecting people, as seen in the anime. Despite this, some Rotom have taken to inhabiting electronics with the intent of helping others. The Rotom Pokédex, Rotom Phones, Rotomi, Rotom Bike, and Drone Rotoms are some examples. The creation of Rotom Pokédex in particular was inspired by Mow Rotom. Some of these particular forms allow Rotom to speak human languages. These forms show that Rotom is also highly intelligent.

It has a chest plate on its torso, which has a deep blue diamond-like crystal embedded in the center. Dialga has a fin-like structure on its back, three spines on the back of its neck, and a crest on its head, resembling a dinosaur. It also has two structures on the sides of its head that extend outward and resemble horns and fangs. It has three claws on each foot, of the same metallic look as its chest plate. Faint cracks exist across its body. The fin-like structure on its back can be used to focus the flow of time, as seen in {{pkmn|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|Explorers of Time, Darkness]], and Sky. Rather than walking on all fours, Dialga usually travels by levitation.\nSaid to be the Pokémon's true form, Dialga's Origin Forme is drastically different from the usual sauropod-like look of its other Forme, being a hybrid between it, a dragon and a centaur, while also resembling its creator, Arceus. The back legs of Dialga become unguligrade in shape and have pointed tips instead of feet. The front legs are noticeably larger, with three distinct rhomb-shaped claws on the underside. Further up, Dialga's knees have rectangular, long and thin protrusions. The chest plate is gone; however, it has a similar polygonal shape in its place. On Dialga's neck is a large shape jutting out towards the front, along with two pairs of protrusions on either side, the upper pair being larger and resembling panels or wings. Inside this large shape and wing-like protrusions are deep blue diamond-like crystals, embedded into diamond-shaped grooves. The three spines located on the back of the neck are longer and sharper. Dialga's head has two thin arrow-shaped horns extending towards the top and back of its head, along with longer fang-like horns connected to a plate mask covering its lower jaw, which can shift in angle to reveal the mouth. The plate mask also partly covers the arrow-shaped horns on their sides. Around Dialga's abdomen is a cross comprised of four arrow shapes attached to a small wheel, reminiscent of Arceus's cross-wheel. The fin-like plate on Dialga's posterior has a star-shaped layer on top of it. The tail is much shorter and crystal-shaped. Overall, Dialga's entire body becomes larger and nearly completely dark blue. The crest, arrow-shaped horns, knee protrusions and abdomen cross are light blue, while the tips of Dialga's fin-like plate and feet are dark gray. Dialga's transformation into its Origin Forme is triggered by a radiant light; it can also be invoked using the Adamant Crystal.\nDialga has the power over time: it can warp time by either speeding it up, slowing it down, or stopping it altogether; it can also travel through time to visit the past, present, and future. It also has the power to destroy and create time itself. In the anime, Dialga's temporal powers possess the ability to devolve anything or anyone against their will: Pokémon, humans, and plants. It can even reverse these devolution effects. It is said that time started moving when Dialga was born and will continue flowing as long as Dialga's heart beats. In its Origin Forme, Dialga can even unleash meteors and shockwaves. The crystals and light blue accents on Dialga's body glow brightly when it uses its powers.\nDialga has the power to create a new universe by itself or with Palkia. As Dialga primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. In the dimension where Origin Forme Dialga lives in, time is said to be constantly moving in different directions and speeds.[1] It has been shown to be very protective of its home. It also tends to have violent conflicts with its counterpart Palkia.\nDialga was revered as a deity in Sinnoh myths; in the past, it was worshipped by the Diamond Clan, who referred to it as \"almighty Sinnoh\". Dialga is capable of speaking through telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Diamond Clan, Adaman. Dialga and Palkia can control and spread the space-time distortions caused by Giratina, which create alpha Pokémon and cause Noble Pokémon to go berserk.\nDialga is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Roar of Time.

It has faint cracks along its legs and tail. As seen in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, Palkia is capable of travelling by creating a large yellow sphere from its two pearls, then using it to fly very fast.\nIn its Origin Forme, which is said to be its true form, Palkia's appearance changes drastically from its other theropod-like Forme, taking on a centaur-dragon hybrid look while resembling its creator, Arceus. The main body becomes larger and grayish pink, with light gray accents on the tips of its wings and legs, along with various dark purple accents. Its shoulder plates are larger and seem to be made of the same pearl-like crystals as the ones embedded at the center, with six rectangular dark purple protrusions surrounding them. Its lower half becomes bigger and resembles that of a horse. Palkia's arms become its forelegs, with hooves, protrusions on the knees, and rectangular spikes on its upper forelegs akin to its other Forme's arms. The back legs gain hooves as well, with heels on the back of the foot, and they are bent in such a way that allows Palkia to stand up on its two back legs. The tail becomes shorter and splits into five. On the center of Palkia's abdomen is a structure consisting of two dark purple circular shapes connected to two circles of the same color, resembling Arceus's cross-like wheel. Palkia's neck and markings on its lower body become shorter. The pointed crest on its neck becomes taller and longer. Its lower jaw gets a plate-like mask covering it, with multiple spikes all over it: one at the front, a pair extending towards the bottom of the jaw, and two pairs on either side extending towards the back. The plate-like mask can be lowered to reveal its mouth when roaring or using attacks. It is believed that Palkia's Origin Forme resembles Arceus as a strategy in order to gain its power. Palkia's transformation into its Origin Forme can be triggered using the Lustrous Globe.\nPalkia has the power over space: it can warp space, travel to faraway places or other dimensions, connect dimensions through dimensional portals as seen in the anime (along with undoing their effects), and destroy space itself. It was said that Palkia can create alternate realities as well. The space Palkia controls is said to become more stable with its every breath. In its Origin Forme, Palkia can walk on all fours and fly, and unleash meteors and shockwaves. The crystals and purple accents on Palkia's body glow brightly when it uses its powers.\nPalkia has the power to create a new universe by itself or with Dialga. Palkia lives in a spatial dimension, making its behavior nearly impossible to study. The dimension Origin Forme Palkia lives in is said to be in shreds like ribbons;[1] however, it is known to be very protective of its home. Palkia has been seen in violent conflicts with its counterpart Dialga.\nPalkia was feared as a deity in Sinnoh myths; in the past, it was worshipped by the Pearl Clan, who referred to it as \"almighty Sinnoh\". Palkia is capable of speaking through telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Pearl Clan, Irida. Palkia and Dialga can control and spread the space-time distortions caused by Giratina, which create alpha Pokémon and cause Noble Pokémon to go berserk.\nPalkia is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Spacial Rend. Palkia can use Spacial Rend to tear both its opponent and the space around them apart at the same time, warping everything it hits. The move can also be charged into a more powerful version while the Pokémon is in its Origin Forme, as shown in the boss battle in Pokémon Legends: Arceus.",

		"biology": "Giratina is a large, gray, draconic Pokémon with three gold half-rings on each side of its long neck. Its head has a gold crown-like object surrounding it with two large horns pointing sideways. A thick black stripe runs vertically along its front with five red horizontal stripes. In its Altered Forme, it has two large black ghostly wings with three red tips on each that can resemble claws. These wings can change shape as if made of a liquid or gas. Its six legs are thick and have golden claws. Two golden half-circles similar to those on its neck are on each side of each leg, resembling shackles. It has a tail. Giratina remains in Altered Forme when outside of its home dimension. It generally moves by levitating itself in the air, as opposed to walking on its six legs.\nIn its Origin Forme, it takes on a serpentine look. Its legs are reduced to golden-tipped spikes, and four additional golden spikes appear near the edge of its tail. While in Origin Forme, the six gold half-rings can grip objects. The back points of each half-ring have a black ghostly tendril with red a spike at its tip. The horns on its head are now facing the back. The sides of the golden \"crown\" cover its mouth and separate vertically like an insect's mandible when it opens its mouth. The black vertical stripe is broken into pieces and runs down its body. Giratina can only be in its Origin Forme when in its home, the Distortion World, or when holding either a Griseous Orb or Griseous Core. Giratina can also maintain its Origin Forme in the real world without items should it get a sufficient amount of power, enough to potentially be equal to Arceus. Giratina is at its full power when in the Origin Forme, and is always levitated in this state.\nThe Origin Forme of Giratina is said to be Giratina's true form, capable of traveling through and controlling dimensions besides those of time and space. When in its Origin Forme, it can pass through dimensions at will, however, it will turn back to its Altered Forme due to the gravity change from the Distortion World. Giratina has the power to turn itself into a shadow and to merge the Distortion World with the Pokémon world, as seen during the events of Spear Pillar. However, this has the dangerous side effect of distorting it to the risk of being destroyed. Giratina is a highly aggressive and territorial Pokémon that is protective of its home. Legends claim that Giratina appears in cemeteries and that it supposedly lives in a world on the reverse side of the Pokémon world. Giratina has also been reported to appear in ancient cemeteries. As seen in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Giratina has the power to tear a hole in reality, creating a space-time distortion along with driving both Dialga and Palkia berserk. The rift is capable of creating the Alpha Pokémon and driving Noble Pokémon into berserk Lord/Lady States. Giratina is said to be equal in strength to Dialga and Palkia.\nGiratina was banished by Arceus for its violent behavior, though in the anime, it is shown to possess a gentler disposition when in the presence of humans. Giratina at one point carried a grudge against its creator Arceus and was willing to stand against it, though years later, it would become a protector of the world. Due to its violent nature, history on Giratina was covered due to ancient people fearing it. Giratina is said to have observed the real world silently while in its home dimension. The anime reveals Giratina can also open portals though anything that reflects. Giratina's role is to keep both worlds in balance. Giratina also had many different titles to it; banished Pokémon, Arceus's shadow, the Pokémon of Shadows, and being on the other side of our world.\nGiratina is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shadow Force by leveling up, which gives it the ability to temporarily turn invisible.",

The striated pattern has similar recurrences on the underside of its mane, tail, and face. Its four pointed feet are tipped with gold hooves. Its long mane juts away from its head, and its face is gray, with green eyes and red pupils, and a green circular pattern below its eyes. Arceus also has a streak of gold coloration on its head, and ears that point upward. Its neck is fairly long, with two pairs of extrusions to the sides, and a flap-like feature on the neck's underside that is colored white like much of the body. Arceus also has a golden cross-like wheel attached to its body by its round abdomen, which changes color along with its eyes and hooves based on its current type, which depends on the Plate or  type-specific Z-Crystal that it wields. The wheel also has four jewels attached to it. The pattern of striated gray of Arceus's underbelly resumes past Arceus's waist. Its limbs have gray undersides and extrusions at the tops of the legs. Arceus's tail is fairly like its mane in terms of shape and coloration. Despite its quadruped appearance, Arceus is capable of flight.\nAccording to legend, it shaped the Pokémon universe using its 1,000 arms. Arceus has been referred to as The Original One in myths and legends, and is generally considered to be one of the strongest Pokémon. Arceus is thought to have created the Sinnoh region and possibly the entire Pokémon world, the lake guardians Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit; and the creation trio Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. Because of this, Arceus is thought to be one of the most long-lived of all Pokémon species. It has the power to recreate the creation trio as well, presumably to guard the dimensions when a Trainer has caught one of them. In the anime, Arceus has been portrayed as having powers such as bringing back things that it once destroyed, making certain things vanish into thin air, halting time, and overturning the very laws of nature. The anime also shows that Arceus has the power to not only calm Dialga and Palkia but also destroy the Red Chain. Arceus can change its type at will in order to adapt to a situation, as seen with its use of Plates (including the Legend Plate) or Z-Crystals. Arceus also has the power to create a piece of itself to exist outside of its home dimension which is just as powerful as the original.\nArceus is shown to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times and protected it from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion in return to those who treated it with equal kindness. In the modern time, Arceus continues to watch over the world, and it wishes for people and Pokémon to work together in face of adversity. Even when it is needed, it would only give out hints for how to solve the problem, instead of directly interfering. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, it is explained that Arceus can give its blessing to Pokémon to make them more powerful, which are referred to as Noble Pokémon and Ride Pokémon, and the power is passed down through family lines. The people of Hisui worshipped the Noble Pokémon. Arceus can also create items for humans to use, such as the Arc Phone. Arceus does not suffer fools gladly, and it will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life, it is said to \"feed\" off the energy of the elemental plates. Arceus has the power to appear in dreams and create a variety of Pokémon to serve as challenges as seen in Eternal Battle Reverie.\nIn the introduction sequence of Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Arceus is shown to be capable of human speech, and it states that Arceus is simply the name humans call it. The first ancient inhabitants of the Hisui region, the Celestica, worshiped it, referring to it as almighty Sinnoh and great Sinnoh. Arceus also had the title might of Sinnoh. The Diamond Clan and Pearl Clan also worship it but mistook Dialga/Palkia for Arceus. It is also implied that its physical form, which the player can obtain, is only a piece of its whole being while its true form is unknown and incomprehensible.\nArceus is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Judgment.

It has two pairs of pointed teeth, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Long, white whiskers extend from its snout and head, and it has a red nose and eyes. On the back of its head is a large, rounded beige helmet-like shell with spikes and a spear-like, pointed protrusion in the front. A dull bluish-gray seashell-like carapace covers its underbelly, and its limbs are covered with beige, sectioned bracer-like coverings, that appear to be made of seashells. The forelimbs' bracers contain swords called seamitars. The lower two segments of these bracers are the scabbards for the two swords, and the upper segment and spike make up the seamitar and its handle. Samurott possess three black digits on each limb, and a fin-like, splayed tail with the innermost section being beige. This tail resembles a war fan.\nWhen in battle, Samurott can stand on its hind legs and use one of its blades as a sword to fight. In the time it takes a foe to blink, it can draw and sheathe the seamitars attached to its front legs; one swing can fell an opponent. It can silence foes with a glare or a howl.\nHisuian Samurott is a rare form of Samurott born from the influences of the Hisui region. The shell on its head has two additional spikes on its sides, and it has a wavy protrusion at the front. Its whiskers are also wavy, with the bottom part being much longer than Unovan Samurott's whiskers. The shells covering its head and legs have sharper edges and are black with red accents, as do its seamitars, which have a wavy blade. There is one less layer of shell covering its hind legs compared to Unovan Samurott. The innermost section of its tail is longer and colored black, while its claws are red.\nHisuian Samurott is said to have a cold and hard-hearted nature, and is deft with its shell blades. Unlike its Unovan counterpart, which prefers fighting fair, Hisuian Samurott will do anything to win a battle, and prefers to use tricks such as surprise attacks and cheap shots. It remains still and silent until it sees an opponent. Then in the blink of an eye, Hisuian Samurott quickly draws out its two seamitars before instantly thrusting at its enemies. The attacks Hisuian Samurott unleashes are comparable to the ceaseless crashes of waves, and can confuse and overwhelm opponents.

Pidove are so forgetful that they will wait for new orders from their Trainers even if it received one right before; in Detective Pikachu, their forgetfulness extends to them not even remembering their own names, while in the anime, it extends to forgetting whatever scared them. Many Trainers love Pidove due to its friendliness and sincere nature. Pidove loves to follow people. Having no fear of people, flocks of Pidove are often found in city parks and plazas, though they can also be seen in grasslands and rural areas. The cooing of these flocks can be very noisy. About several hundred Pidove are known to gather when food is scattered on the ground for them.",

It possesses dark green, linear leaves under the flower, and light green, linear leaves underneath the darker leaves. One of the light green leaves, on the back of its head, is about as long as its body and resembles hair. Two light green leaves loosely hang down from its head. Its head and abdomen are white and its eyes, which resemble seeds, are a light shade of scarlet. It has dark green, linear leaves for arms, and a golden sepal under its neck. It wears a large, light green, tulip shaped collection of leaves, resembling a dress. There are two long, dark green, linear leaves coming from its back to around the bottom of its \"dress\". It also possesses another golden, sepal-shaped extension underneath its \"dress\", resembling feet.\nThough Lilligant is popular with celebrities, veteran Trainers and first-rate gardeners alike have struggled to coax the flower on Lilligant's head into blooming. The flowers bloomed by Lilligant in the wild are also said to be the most beautiful despite all these efforts. Once it blooms, it will wilt if Lilligant is then neglected or when it finds a male partner. The flower emits a sweet-smelling aroma, and it is believed to have a relaxing effect on those exposed to the scent. The flower's fragrance differs slightly depending on the soil it was cultivated in. The oil made by Lilligant's flowers has a sublime scent and is very expensive to buy. It is a rare Pokémon that lives in forests. Lilligant is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nIn Hisui, Lilligant takes on a drastically different look. Hisuian Lilligant has a thinner build. Its head and body are white, and the latter is covered in light green leaves, with two small slightly darker leaves coming out from either side. On the left side of its head is a six-petaled pink flower with short filaments jutting out from it, and dark green leaves underneath it.

It also has long, powerful legs, and they are white with a dark pink gradient at the calves. It is suspected that these legs developed as a result of living in the snowy mountains of Hisui; they allow Hisuian Lilligant to jump very high and gracefully. Its feet are golden and cover part of its legs, and they seem to resemble dance shoes or snow boots.\nA special Hisuian Lilligant is worshiped in Hisui due to it being one of the 10 ancient Pokémon who received a blessing from Arceus.

They have a green, ovoid body, tapering off in the rear to a trapezoidal tail fin. A thick black stripe covers the top of their body from mouth to tail and a white, dorsal fin with four protrusions resembling spikes. Their lower jaw juts ahead of their upper jaw, with a small indent near the edges of their mouth. Both forms have three black dots on both sides of their body, behind their pectoral fins.\nThe main difference between the three forms of Basculin is the color of the stripe that separates the black and green on their body. All forms of Basculin have fins in the same places, with one on top of their body ahead of the tail fin, one below the body ahead of the tail fin, and two side fins. The Red-Striped Form has jagged fins that resemble tridents, whereas the Blue-Striped Form has smooth fins all around. The Red-Striped Form have circular, red eyes, while the Blue-Striped Form have narrower, blue eyes.\nRed- and Blue-Striped Basculin are extremely hostile, especially towards their opposite form. They generally start fighting each other on sight for territory. However, on rare occasions, one form may swim with the other's school. Basculin is full of vitality and reproduces quickly. When a school of Basculin appears in a lake, Pokémon other than Corphish and Crawdaunt flee. It competes with Carvanha for food.\nBasculin has often been referred to as \"the thug of the lake\" or \"Thug of the River\", and uses its jaws, which are strong enough to leave bite marks in iron sheets, to devour everything in its way. However, despite their fierce reputation, Basculin become prey to stronger organisms, such as Bombirdier and Dondozo. Basculin were once also consumed by humans, and were considered very delicious. The meat of Blue-Striped Basculin has an inoffensive, light flavor, while the meat of Red-Striped Basculin is fattier, and was more popular with the youth. Basculin is a popular Pokémon with anglers due to its resistance. Many people release Basculin into lakes illegally, causing its population to grow abundant.\nIn Hisui, White-Striped Basculin has a similar appearance to the other two forms of Basculin. Despite its descriptor, the stripes above its eyes are actually a very pale shade of light blue, as are its irises. Its pectoral fins are smooth like Blue-Striped Basculin, but larger. Its dorsal fins are spiky and it has wide eyes, like Red-Striped Basculin. Its lower jaw is smaller than the jaws of either Red- or Blue-Striped Basculin, and both its lower and upper jaws have beak-like protrusions at the front. White-Striped Basculin is considered a regional form by technicality due to similarities on what classifies as one.\nUnlike the other two forms, White-Striped Basculin are known to be gentle. They are known to travel upstream; the journey is often perilous for the species, and many of them don't survive. As a result, the souls of the deceased White-Striped Basculin are often left behind in the waters of Hisui. However, when an injured White-Striped Basculin survives, it can unite with the souls in order to achieve the unique evolution into Basculegion.",

It usually burrows under the surface of the sand, with only its nose and eyes appearing above ground. Due to being so close to the surface, it can move around the desert and allow the heat of the sand to regulate its body temperature. This also serves as a way of hiding from enemies. Its movement through sand has been described as being similar to swimming. When the sun sets, it burrows deep into the sand to sleep until sunrise. As seen in the anime, in the wild, Sandile can be mischievous and potentially troublesome to humans. However, Sandile will protect another of its species, and can be caring at times. Sandile is an ambush predator, hiding under the sand and waiting for unwary prey, such as Trapinch, to walk over it before it bites on their legs.

The upper portion of its tan face is separated from the lower portion by a diagonal red stripe, and its large mouth sports spiked teeth. All these facial features give the impression of a manic or angered expression. Its head has no discernible neck to distinguish it from the rest of the body and its rounded back, which culminates in a stubby tail. It has long arms with spiky hair fringes on the wrists and large tan hands, with a similar arrangement for its hind limbs. Additionally, Darmanitan has three tan ovals on its underside and two wavy lines on its back. In its normal state, it has immense physical strength; a single punch can destroy a dump truck. Its power level scales with the temperature of its internal fire, which can be as hot as 2,500 °F (1,400 °C).\nDuring Zen Mode, which is accessed by Darmanitan with the hidden Ability Zen Mode, its red fur and tan skin changes blue as it bears the resemblance of a Daruma doll. Its eyes turn blank, and its limbs fuse with its body, rendering them immobile. It also only has three toes, as opposed to normal Darmanitan having five. In this state, it is hard as a rock.

It develops an organ that produces cold air, while its flame sac becomes dormant. This also causes its nature to change, from a belligerent personality to a gentle and timid one. It becomes so timid that it will pretend to be a snowman when it senses humans nearby. It uses the snowball on its head to store food and other things it finds, preserving them for later.

Its muzzle is short and tapered with two small fangs seen in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Zorua possesses a ruff of black fur around its neck and four short limbs tipped with red. Its tail is short and bushy. Zorua can change its physical appearance, though this transformation is merely an illusion as it keeps its own type and moves.\nZorua is said to have a timid nature which led to the development of its illusion abilities. Zorua keeps its true form hidden to ensure its safety, and takes on the appearance of other Pokémon to frighten off enemies. Sometimes it will take the form of a silent child in order to search for food. It have been known to occasionally replace normally talkative children.

It can even create illusory landscapes in the forests where it dwells, to hide its territory and protect its den. However, Zoroark is incapable of physically changing itself into another form; it is merely capable of casting illusions. When a Zoroark takes the form of a human, it is capable of human speech. It can make convincing illusions of attacks, and these illusions are extremely realistic, enough to fool even cameras and make one believe they're being physically affected, though the illusion does not have any direct physical effect.

The arms and legs have several red spots and light red fur that dangles around. The claws and toes of Zoroark are colored black. The eyes are now red with yellow sclera.\nAs a result of its appearance, Hisuian Zoroark was said to resemble an embodiment of death. The illusions channeled through Hisuian Zoroark's long withering fur are full of spite. Uniquely, this spiteful illusion can cause physical harm to its opponent on both the inside and outside.

In fact, it is too small to generate its own electricity, so it attaches itself to larger Pokémon and feeds off their static electricity. More than often it prefers sticking on Yamper's hindquarters. It will also make its way into houses and feed off electricity in electrical sockets. All of the energy it absorbs it stores in an electric pouch on its body.

Conversely, with its central head housing its brain, Hydreigon is said to be highly intelligent in spite of its constantly destructive thoughts. Hydreigon lives high up in the air and has been known to ambush opponents from above. Many stories described Hydreigon destroying entire villages. However, Hydreigon is afraid of Noivern during nighttime. It is said Hydreigon's reason for being ferocious is due to ancient people loathing it. The ancient people believed Hydreigon was evil incarnate, hence always attacking it.\nIron Jugulis shares a resemblance to Hydreigon.

Its shoulders are covered in 'squares' of ice with two pins protruding from each which can come out and 'plug into' the aforementioned holes. As White Kyurem, it has thin arms with two rings and three claws each, wings between the rings on its forearms, and its right arm and wing are frozen. As Black Kyurem, it has Zekrom's arms, but more muscular and without wings, and its left arm and wing are frozen. Its neck is the same shape, but becomes upright; White Kyurem uses Reshiram's fur and Black Kyurem uses Zekrom's skin.\nIn both forms, the ice covering one of Kyurem's jaws (upper for White Kyurem, lower for Black Kyurem) has partially disappeared, allowing it to move its mouth. During a battle, Black Kyurem and White Kyurem enter Overdrive mode and tubes sprout from its back to its tail. In White Kyurem's case, the ends of its hair and wings become fiery and its tail acquires fiery highlights. In Black Kyurem's case, parts of its right arm and the tip of the horn on the back of its head turn blue, while its tail lights up with electricity. In Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice, Kyurem can also change into Black Kyurem or White Kyurem without fusing by channeling the power of powers of both Reshiram and Zekrom it has within itself.\nKyurem generates powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body became frozen when the energy leaked out. By keeping its body frozen, the cellular structure will remain stable. It is said to have a power that exceeds that of Reshiram and Zekrom; however, this power is kept at bay by the extreme cold. Kyurem also shares Reshiram's or Zekrom's beliefs in truth or ideals, respectively, when fused with either of the two dragons. Due to an old legend, it may be assumed Kyurem may be hostile towards Pokémon and humans, due to the fact it supposedly ate them if they were found outside at night. It is said to be an extraterrestrial Pokémon, according to folklore.\nKyurem and its forms have several signature moves:\nKyurem is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Glaciate by leveling up.\nWhite Kyurem is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Ice Burn.\nWhite Kyurem and Reshiram are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fusion Flare by leveling up.\nBlack Kyurem is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Freeze Shock.\nBlack Kyurem and Zekrom are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fusion Bolt by leveling up.\n\n\n\nBlack Kyurem in Overdrive mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Kyurem in Overdrive mode",

The poison it ingests is processed and turned into a black powder that it scatters all over its body. This powder causes paralysis on contact, and allows Scatterbug to deter bird Pokémon from attacking. The powder also regulates Scatterbug's temperature, allowing it to adapt to any climate. Grafaiai is a natural predator of Scatterbug.[1]",

It has round black ears with pale yellow interiors, black eyes, a tiny nose, and a prominent upper incisor with a slight point. On each cheek is a circular, dark orange electric sac with two black whiskers. The upper whiskers have branches and resemble antennae, while the lower whiskers are simple. There is a thick black stripe down its back and it has a pale yellow belly. It has stubby limbs with three digits on each paw and a long, thin black tail with a tuft of fur on the tip.\nDedenne's upper whiskers serve as antennae that can send and receive electrical waves. This allows it to communicate with others of its kind over great distances, sharing locations of food or electricity, and sense its surroundings. The simple, lower whiskers are organs that can fire electricity. However, Dedenne is small and its electricity-generating organ is under-developed, making it unable to generate a lot of electricity on its own. It absorbs electricity from other electric Pokémon, or from homes and buildings by plugging its tail into outlets; Dedenne are known to live near humans due to this behavior. When it is low on charge, it curls up and sleeps.",

On top of its head are two pairs of antenna-like horns; the front horns are small nubs, while the hind horns are considerably longer. Its gelatinous body forms a spiral shell-like structure on its back. Contained within the shell are its brain and other organs.\nSliggoo excretes and coats its body with sticky mucus that can dissolve anything. Because it lacks teeth, it sprays this liquid onto prey and slurps them up once they are dissolved. Since its slime can melt through anything, predators stay far away from it. Its eyes have devolved, causing it to go blind. This makes it difficult for it to tell allies from prey and it will sometimes attempt to melt its companions. Its four horns act as a radar system and are used to detect sounds and smells. Sliggoo only cares about food and will flee from its enemies whenever possible.\nHisuian Sliggoo has droopy, teal eyes that imply its melancholic personality, and carries a metallic spiral shell that lies parallel to the ground. Unlike its Kalosian form, it has one teal spot on each cheek rather than two. It tucks almost its entire body inside this shell, and will only let out its head, neck and arms to peek outside.\nWhen Hisuian Sliggoo wants to move quickly, it will tuck its entire body into its shell, position the shell vertical to the ground, and roll itself away. It can also use its shell to float on water. It's theorized that the shell was created as a result of Hisuian Sliggoo's slime reacting with the iron-rich waters of Hisui.

		"biology": "A Zygarde Core A Zygarde CellZygarde is a Pokémon whose form depends on the percentage of its Cores and Cells gathered together. The Zygarde Cores are the brain of the Zygarde, and a Zygarde may contain one or five Cores. A Zygarde Core is a small, green Pokémon with a gelatinous body. It has a large, round head with a beak-shaped protrusion on the front, a thin, hook-shaped tail, and a red hexagon suspended in its body. Within its head is a single eye with a black pupil; beside this eye is another white oval that may be a second eye. As seen in the anime, Zygarde Cores are capable of absorbing sunlight to regain their strength, can speak telepathically, and use the Cells to observe the ecosystem. Zygarde Cells make up every other part of Zygarde and appear nearly identical to the Zygarde Core. Unlike the Core, it has a flat body and head. It has a green pupil, a simpler, unhooked tail, and has a darker green, more elongated hexagon within its midsection.\nZygarde 10% Forme has a relatively small canine body. It is primarily black with a green collar and a leash-like extension on its neck. Additional green markings include: two hexagon markings on its chest, a small hexagon over each eye, the area around its mouth, and its front left paw. There is an elongated, red hexagon marking attached to the collar marking. Its eyes are white hexagons with no discernible pupils and there is a thin, white line on its forehead. On each of its legs are hexagonal extensions: two on the back of each elbow, one behind each knee, and two on each hip. One of the hip extensions is longer than the other on each hip. Zygarde 10% Forme also has razor-sharp teeth.\nZygarde 50% Forme has a serpentine body with green and black markings. Most of its back, head, and neck are black, while the underbelly and the tip of its tail are green. Its eyes are made of four green hexagons, similar to an insect with compound eyes, and there is a thin, white line down the center of its face. Across the back of its neck is a large frill made of five long, flat protrusions that each have two small, green hexagons on them. There are three short tendrils on either side of its chest; they are black on the right and green on the left. Its tail also ends in five tendrils. It has many small, green hexagon markings on its body capable of glowing.\nZygarde Complete Forme has a large, humanoid body with a long tail similar to Zygarde 50% Forme's body. There are several flat protrusions around its head and triangular protrusions around its neck. These protrusions create a crown-shape. On its face are three white hexagonal marks: one in the middle of its forehead with a line through it and two that act as eyes. There are an additional five green hexagons on its face: four along the bottom and one in the middle of a short protrusion on top. Each shoulder has two serpentine wings protruding from it. The wings all have an undulating pattern and a hexagon near the tip: blue on the right side and red on the left. There are multiple white protrusions on its body: three on each hand acting as claws, one on each knee, and one and the front of each foot. Additionally, there are green hexagons surrounding its wrists and two under the white protrusions on its knees and feet. Its abdomen has a vertical, hexagonal pattern with a thin, white line on either side. Across its chest is a thin, zigzagging opening that fades between five colors: red, orange, white, cyan, and blue. The chest can open, revealing five cores of each color. Above this opening are two large green, hexagonal marks.\nZygarde cells tend to be scattered around the region while the Core remains in watch, usually living in caves. Zygarde's Cores and Cells do not have the power to battle alone and can only fight when combined to form Zygarde. The Cores have their own will and are sometimes able to act on their own, while the Cells form the rest of Zygarde's body and are only able to act on the Core's orders.[1]\n10% Zygarde is created when a Zygarde core combines with only 10% of the total Zygarde Cells. 10% Zygarde Forme is skilled at close range combat. It is also capable of running at speeds greater than 60 miles per hour (100 kilometers per hour). A single Core acts as the brain for the 10% form. This allows it to take action separately from Zygarde's 50% Forme, which comprises its main body, for a short time before separating.[2]\nThe 50% Forme of Zygarde is formed from half of its Cores and Cells reuniting. Zygarde is thought to monitor those who destroy the ecosystem from deep within its cave. This form of Zygarde is known to be both ruthless and mercilessly destroying anyone who stand it its way. Should the region's ecosystem fall into disarray, it will appear and reveal its power. This power is Zygarde changing into the powerful Complete Forme. As seen in the anime, Zygarde can summon and control massive roots, which it can use to attack and cover areas.\nThe Complete Forme of Zygarde is formed when all 100% of its Cells And Cores come together. Zygarde Complete Forme contains separate Cores for each of its wings and its tail. In this case, each Core can make decisions and act independently of the others.[3] Possessing all of its total cells, Zygarde Complete Forme is said to exceed both Xerneas and Yveltal in power. The opening on its chest can radiate enough energy to destroy anything around it. This form only appears to neutralize threats to the ecosystems or should anything happen to its other two counterparts.\nZygarde is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Land's Wrath, Thousand Arrows, Thousand Waves, and Core Enforcer.",

It also has a stubby beak with a white upper jaw and an orange-brown lower jaw, and a few short tufts of feathers on the back of its head. Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an asymmetric cut; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two sharp orange-brown feathers known as blade quills. Dartrix has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward.\nThis alert Pokémon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to make mistakes; when it does, it sometimes tries to cover it up, which ends up making the situation worse.

A tiara-like structure rests on its forehead, consisting of a line of pearls with a pink sea star at one corner and a thin, transparent blue fin extending back over its hair. Its hair is contained to a ponytail by two strings of pearls. This ponytail, as shown in the games and anime, becomes temporarily undone when it performs certain moves. On its body are three fins similar to the one on its crown: one that drapes around its shoulders and chest, one around its waist where the fishtail begins, and one near the tip of its tail. It has long front fins with three digits. Primarina's long fishlike tail is bright blue with small pointed, pink fins around its hips. Its tail fins are white, and it is capable of using them as feet to stand up.\nPrimarina uses water balloons and its voice as its main weapons. Because its voice is instrumental in its battle strategy, its care should be a priority for Trainers. The melody it uses has been passed down for generations. Water balloons are released as it dances, and are controlled by its voice. In the moonlight, the balloons glitter and create a beautiful scene. However, some of the balloons are explosive and triggered by touch. This theatrical Pokémon considers every battle a stage and uses the non-explosive balloons as platforms to tease opponents.[1]\nPrimarina is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Sparkling Aria by leveling up. Primarina is also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Oceanic Operetta.",

There are gases inside its beak, which can ignite and launch seeds with enough force to shatter boulders. Additionally, its temperature can exceed 212 °F (100 °C) and cause severe burns on contact. Toucannon can use this beak to warm up eggs, as shown in the anime.\nExcept for the black tip on the upper part, Toucannon's beak can change colors as it heats up, although it normally has four bands of red, orange, and yellow at the top, and solid red on the mandible. As Toucannon heats up its beak, the bands on the upper beak glow and turn red (or sometimes bright yellow in the anime) one-by-one, from tip to base. When its beak cools down, both of its parts are momentarily solid yellow, before resuming their normal colorations.\nAround the base of the beak is a thin black band with two extensions into the upper jaw similar to nostrils. There is a white marking covering Toucannon's chin and chest, and a half-circle, yellow marking on each cheek. Toucannon has dark blue eyes, light blue eyelids, and jagged, gray eyebrows.

The feet have three toes in front and one in back, and the beak curves downward.\nIn its Baile Style, which resides in Ula'ula Island, Oricorio is covered in red feathers with two lines of black feathers across each of its wings and tail. Its plumage resembles a frilly flamenco dress. On the back of its head is a white ball with thin, spiraled extensions on either side that resemble earrings. Its eyelids are purple, and it has a long tail.\nBaile Style Oricorio is very passionate and exudes power when it dances, and can get fiercely angry if it is given the wrong orders. It throws off downy fluff when it dances that it can ignite to perform a fiery dance attack.[1] In Paldea, Baile Style Oricorio is popular with the people of Paldea due to its dancing style matching their temperament nature.\nIn its Pom-Pom Style, residing in Melemele Island, Oricorio is primarily yellow. Most of its body is pale yellow with a line of longer feathers around its waist like a skirt. Its lower body and short stubby tail are covered with short, white feathers. Fluffy balls of darker yellow feathers cover the end of its wings like pom-poms, and similar, smaller puffs cover its ankles. In the center of its chest is a yellow, v-shaped marking, and there are fan-shaped markings on the sides of its eyes. The markings around its eyes are echoed by three large, pale yellow feathers on each side of its head, which are tipped with bright yellow.\nPom-Pom Style Oricorio's dancing charges its feathers with static electricity. While charged, its feathers can be used to attack and unleash electric shocks. It will also use its dancing to cheer up people who are feeling glum, but will also use this as an opening to shock unsuspecting foes. In Paldea, Pom-Pom Style is popular with Children due to its energetic, cheerful dance. However, it is hard to find in said region.\nIn its Pa'u Style, residing in Akala Island, Oricorio has pink feathers.

On the top of its head is an arrangement of feathers resembling a headdress: a ring of fluffy, light pink feathers with larger, paler feathers standing up from the center. There is a larger, similar group of feathers around its waist like a skirt.\nPa'u Style Oricorio can be difficult to deal with due to its laid-back nature. It uses its dance to focus its mind and increase its psychic power. The dance is also said to be an offering of thanks to its guardian deity.[2] It gets caught up in dancing that it sometimes ignores its Trainer's orders. In Paldea, Pau'u Style Oricorio is popular due to being used to maintain health. However, it is hard to find in said region.\nIn its Sensu Style, residing in Poni Island, Oricorio's feathers are mainly purple.

It has short red fur with white on its lower legs and a white streak that covers its face, underbelly, and tail. It has pointed, button ears with black tips, three large tufts of fur on each side of its face, a triangular black nose, and a mouth full of sharp teeth. While the sclerae, irises, and pupils of its eye are visible, they all glow a pinkish red and no distinctive colors are visible. A mane of fur covers its back and shoulders, sweeping forward over its head to form a crescent moon shape. On either side of its body, just below the shoulders, two small rocks resembling claws poke out of the mane. A single, bigger stone projects out of the front of the mane over its head. Each of this form's paws has three black claws, and it has a stubby tail covered in long fur.\nIn its Dusk Form, Lycranroc resembles a combination of its Midday and Midnight Forms. Its body is similar to Midday Form with the same white color except with orange-gold fur. It retains the three brown claws for all four feet. The white fluffy mane resembles a sun with part of the crescent moon. It also has four rocks around its neck like a sun as well along with a single, bigger stone coming from the mane over its head. Its face resembles Midday Form Lycanroc's but is orange-gold with bright green eyes, which can change to bright glowing red when angry or attacking.\nThe Midday Form has a calm, collected, and cautious personality. In order to avoid needless fighting, the Midday Form prefers to live alone and does not form a pack with others of its kind. However, it is a fiercely loyal partner to Trainers that accept it during its unruly stage. In battle, it darts past opponents while attacking them with the rocks in its mane. These swift movements leave many foes bewildered and backed into a corner.[1] It always aims for the foes' weak spot using its fangs. Broken fragments of its stone mane are considered good luck.\nIn contrast, Lycanroc's Midnight Form is thrilled by battling and becomes more excited the stronger its opponent. This excitement is what causes its eyes to glow. [2] The Midnight Form is known to be reckless along with extremely vicious temper. Its strategy consists of closing in on its opponent and encouraging attack, then countering with a powerful blow that knocks out its opponent. The full force of its headbutts can destroy giant boulders. Trainers that can draw out its power earn its trust, but it despises those that it disagrees with or who try to force it to fight.\nThe Dusk Form Lycanroc shares traits from the previous two forms. Its stance, calm demeanor, and loyal nature are shared with the Midday Form. However, it also shares the Midnight Form's fighting spirit, including the red, glowing eyes at the moment of attack. Dusk Form Lycranoc never barks, unlike its two other forms. Upon entering battle, Lycanroc will relentlessly drive its opponents into a corner. Due to only evolving at sunset, the Dusk Form is considered the rarest of the three forms. [3] The Dusk Form of Lycanroc is rather difficult to train due to its temperamental nature. Because of this, Dusk Form Lycanroc is considered the most troublesome of its three forms.\nLycranroc are used by humans as guards, to protect their fields from prey Deerling.\nLycanroc is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Splintered Stormshards.\nLycanroc's Midday and Dusk Forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Accelerock.",

		"biology": "Wishiwashi is a fishlike Pokémon. It has two different forms depending on the situation.\nIn its Solo Form, Wishiwashi resembles a small fish. It has large, light blue eyes with irises that resemble puddles of water and dark blue eyelids. The head and tail are both white. There is a line of white teardrop-shapes on each side of its body with the teardrop nearest the head being slightly larger. The top half of its body is dark blue and has a short, rounded dorsal fin. The lower half of its body is gray with two pectoral fins. This tiny Pokémon is both the shortest and lightest Water-type.\nIn its School Form, Wishiwashi resembles a large fish roughly formed from various smaller fish with glowing eyes. Starting with its head, its body is divided into four bands that each becomes a slightly darker shade of blue. A ring of bright blue glowing spots lines the front edge of the two middle bands. The centers of its \"eyes\" are formed by a single white fish with glowing eyes for pupils. Surrounding the white fish is a dark blue recess, and at the rear edge of the \"eye\" is a raised white area for eyelids. Above each eye is a single, dark blue fish shape. Wishiwashi's mouth gapes wide open, apparently unable to close fully due to gaps on each side. Its lips in the front are lined with glowing spots, and many more spots dot the inside of its mouth.\nOn each side of the School Form's body, in the second band, there is a pair of dark blue fish-shaped recesses. Wishiwashi is able to fire fish-shaped torpedoes from this area. Its pectoral fins are the same color as its head and have three finger-like projections. There are glowing spots at the base of each \"finger\" and at the base of the fins themselves. On top of its head are two short projections shaped like fishtails, one behind the other. Additionally, Wishiwashi has a large dorsal fin that is darker around the base and has two glowing spots at the tip. The third section of its body has a ring of four spike-like fins around it. Three spikes encircle the tip of its tail, each with two glowing dots at the base. Dark fish shapes float freely a short distance from the end of each spike, all with two more dots on them. Finally, the tip of its tail is a rounded teardrop-shape with a single dot on each side.\nAn individual Wishiwashi is small, weak, and notably tasty. As a result Wishiwashi has numerous natural predators, including humans, Dewgong, Wailmer, Wailord, Wingull, and Pelipper. While Wishiwashi are known to move in schools, they're more often seen alone. Wishiwashi also gather when confronting opponents. It can call on its friends by shining its eyes seen as an SOS signal almost 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.[1][2]\nThe people of Alola and Galar, however, still fear Wishiwashi and call it the \"demon of the sea\" due to its School Form. Even the fearsome Gyarados and Wailord are known to flee from it when it enters School Form. Wishiwashi assumes this form whenever a Wishiwashi is in danger or is bullied. Wishiwashi can concentrate their powers when assembled. The School Form's Water Gun is said to be more powerful than a Hydro Pump move. Should it get wounded in School Form, Wishiwashi will split into a regular school before fleeing.\nA special Wishiwashi is worshiped in Lental for being one of the seven guardian Illumina Pokémon. It resides in the Maricopia Islands Illumina Spot.",

The body consists of two sections; the top section is slightly smaller and overlaps the lower. On top of its head is a starfish-like collection of ten tentacles. All of the tentacles reach the ground, except for the one directly in front, which is shorter and leaves its face exposed. The tentacles are light blue and covered in purple spines. On top of its head is a purple area with a collection of spikes with a larger, yellow spine in the center.\nMareanie is able to regenerate any body part overnight, except its head. The lost limbs have a very bitter, astringent flavor, and thus they cannot be eaten as food. Bruxish feeds on Mareanie, which in turn eats the branches of Corsola — except in Galar, where it has not yet learned to prey on them. Mareanie also eats broken-off Pincurchin spines, despite the risk of getting electrocuted. It uses the spike on top of its head to poison its prey and uses its tentacles to either trap its prey or deal the final blow. In the anime, it has also been seen attaching itself with all of its tentacles and releasing poison through its spines. The poison causes numbness and intense itching.

The main part of its body, consisting of a small head with protrusions similar to starfish arms below it, is a purplish pink. Its head is dark blue on top, near where its legs connect. This part of its body is typically suspended in the air due to the length of its legs.\nThe legs themselves are light blue on top and dark blue on the undersides. The legs are filled with spines, which can protrude towards the outer leg or retract into the inner leg. The inner spines are purplish pink, and when they are present, the outer spines sink back into its legs, and vice versa. The tip of each legs has two orange claws, and there is a ring of orange spines around a purplish-pink marking where all the legs meet on top.\nToxapex uses its legs to walk along the ocean floor, where it hunts for Corsola. They can also be used to create a dome-like shelter, protecting it from the tides and, in colder regions, trapping its body heat to keep it warm. Toxapex's spines sense the flow of tides, allowing it to survey its surroundings. Its spines can also be fired at enemies and carry a powerful poison, which causes pain for 72 hours (3 days), even to Pokémon as large as Wailord. Aftereffects of the venom remain even after recovery. If a foe bypasses its spines, it attacks with its claws instead. Bruxish is its natural enemy. Toxapex competes against it in warm ocean currents, despite the odds being against it.\nToxapex is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Baneful Bunker.

Black bangs hang over its face before turning into a stiff mane along its neck. Additionally, it has a short, black tail. Thick, cream-colored mud surrounds each black hoof.\nMudbray can be kept happy by giving it time to frolic in and consume mud. Mudbray's diet consists of eating dirt in order to create mud. It then regurgitated the mud in order to cover itself in it. Mudbray's mud won't dry out, even when exposed to sun for long periods of time. Denying it this will cause it to become stressed and disobey its Trainer. This Pokémon boasts immense strength for its size and is able to drag or carry loads up to 50 times its own weight. Mudbray are known to be skilled at using mud. The mud that collects around its hooves enhance its grip and power. Notably, it allows Mudbray to travel rough terrains without slipping. Because it was hunted nearly to extinction when it lived all over the world, it was believed for a time to run wild only in Alola.[1] Despite this, Mudbray have been seen roaming in Galar and Paldea, suggesting that its population is slowly recovering from near extinction.",

When galloping, its hooves can dig holes in asphalt. While it is not swift, it has excellent stamina and can continue on for three days and three nights while dragging over 10 tons. It will mix dirt and saliva to create a special mud with resistance to both wind and water. The mud is also harder than even stone.

It will not stay in the same spot for more than a day due to the danger involved. If anything bothers it while it is gathering sunlight, Fomantis will fiercely attack it. The reason is that Fomantis hates its naps being disturbed. When regularly exposed to sunlight, it grows up with vivid coloration. Though it excels at long-range attacks, it will rarely use those that require it to use its stored photosynthetic energy.[1] Fomantis can give off a sweet and refreshing scent.

It shows affection with a fond embrace, but its hugs have incredible force. Trainers of this Pokémon must teach it how to restrain itself when showing affection.[1] Its hugs are powerful enough to shatter bones and have killed many Trainers.

When it sheds its rocky coating, its Core Form is both the lightest Rock-type and Flying-type Pokémon. Both of its forms tie with Carbink and Dwebble as the shortest Rock-type.\nIn its Meteor Form, Minior resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star-shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place.\nIn its Core Form, Minior loses its rocky shell and its body is exposed. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, Minior's core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. Minior's eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how Minior spins the rest of its body.\nMinior forms in the stratosphere from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, Minior becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a Poké Ball quickly enough. The cute, pastel coloring of Minior's Core Form often inspires designers to use it as a motif for clothing and accessories.[1] While in the ozone layer, it serves as food to stronger Pokémon such as Rayquaza. Places where Minior fall are few, Alola being one of them.",

		"biology": "Komala is a gray Pokémon similar to a koala. It has large, rounded ears with light orange fur on the inside. Its large, ovoid black nose extends up between its fluffy white eyebrows, and there are additional white puffs of fur on each cheek. There is a small ruff of longer, gray fur around its neck. Each hand is black with five short fingers, and it has three black claws and a black paw pad on each foot. Its underbelly is white, as is its short fluffy tail. Komala is usually seen holding a short wooden log, which it is given at birth. The log is typically a light brown with darker, oval markings all over it. The ends of the log are tan with the growth rings visible.\nThis Pokémon stays asleep from birth to death, staying this way because of its diet of certain leaves containing poison only Komala can break down, which induces sedative properties. While its expression sometimes changes as if it is aware of its surroundings, this appears to be a result of its dreams instead. It is able to eat, travel, and even battle without waking. If the log pillow it clings to is removed, it will be unable to sleep well and thrash wildly. However, it will sometimes cling to the arm of a Trainer it trusts. During a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether. According to ancient people, if a small amount of the saliva created when it eats leaves is watered down and ingested, one will be able to sleep well.[1] This diluted saliva was also historically used as an anaesthetic for surgeries. Hypno has been known to hunt this Pokémon in Alola, appearing to prefer them over humans.\nKomala is the only known Pokémon with the Ability of Comatose.",

On top of its head is an additional shell with many points around the brim. This extra shell has a black center, yellow in the middle, and a red outer rim. Its eyes have black markings around the bottom, and it has a tubular, yellow snout with a single, large nostril. Turtonator has a wide mouth with the lower lip marked by a jagged yellow line extending from its nose. On each side of Turtonator's long neck are two short, triangular projections. Its front legs have mitten-like hands, while its hind feet have claw-like red growths around them. Most of its tail is also covered by red plating, which has fin-like projections. The shell that encases its body has a red underside with a star-shaped, yellow-rimmed hole in the center. The back of the shell has a yellow center with several spikes: four large spikes with red bases form a star shape in the center with four smaller spikes around them.\nThis Pokémon resides on volcanoes, where it camouflages itself among the rocks and waits for prey. In addition to hunting, Turtonator also feeds on sulfur and other volcanic materials. This diet rich in explosive material has contributed to a layer of explosive material in its shell. This diet also makes Turtonator's feces dangerously explosive. The feces can be put to many different uses; in Pokémon Adventures, they can be used as makeshift landmines, exploding from a mere touch. When prey steps onto its shell, it strikes itself with its own tail to cause an explosion. The explosion is ignited by sparks from the spikes on its shell and released through the hole on its chest.[1] This orifice also acts as Turtonator's weak point. Its explosive capabilities are dampened by the rain, however, so it takes refuge in caves on rainy days. It is also capable of spewing poisonous gas and flames from its nostrils.\nTurtonator is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shell Trap.",

Occasionally, it will also extend a black appendage from under its rag. The veil itself resembles a Pikachu. The cloth is yellow with black-tipped ears. The Pikachu face appears to be drawn with crayons, consisting of black eyes, red cheeks, and a squiggly black mouth. The head is hollow and can be used to store objects. Mimikyu also carries a small stick resembling a lightning bolt to create a tail for its costume. When its disguise is damaged, the costume's head droops limply backward, revealing Mimikyu's ruse. Larger rips in the costume are accompanied by shadowy vapors pouring out from whatever is hidden within.\nA lonely Pokémon, Mimikyu is always covered by its disguise. It is unknown what Mimikyu's true appearance looks like. Since this Pokémon is weakened by sunlight, it is rumored that the veil is used for protection. It is believed that seeing its true form will cause a mysterious illness or even a painful death. Because of this, Mimikyu will become agitated and violently stop anyone from attempting to look underneath its rag. Mimikyu's disguise is modeled after Pikachu because of the popularity of Pikachu-styled merchandise, thinking that its disguise would allow it to make friends with people.[1] Unfortunately, this attempt makes its disguise look more creepy. Until recent times, Mimikyu was initially thought by humans to be just a ghost wearing a cloth. Mimikyu is capable of floating in the air.\nThe rag it wears allows Mimikyu to avoid attacks. Mimikyu will keep up its disguise, even if rag is broken. However, if its rag is damaged or its neck is broken, it will spend all night patching it in front of a mirror as if its life depends on it. Repairing the rag correctly is often difficult for Mimikyu, so it cries a lot on the inside. It then seeks revenge on the one that damaged it, fearing that its true identity could have been exposed.

It has light blue eyes, white eyelids, and a light blue, fin-like marking around the outer corner of each eye. It has a white T-shaped marking on its forehead and a small, white V-shape on its chest. Around its shoulders are segmented purple rings and its long thin arms have webbed hands with three fingers. Each finger is tipped with a purple claw. On the front of its lower body is a light blue, fin-like projection with three spikes. It also has light blue fins on top of its head that resemble long, flowing hair.\nTapu Fini's main body resides inside a violet shell that resembles a swordfish head when closed. The top half of the shell has a fin with light blue webbing on top and a thin, pointed spine on the front. On each side of the top shell are two C-shaped markings facing each other to form a rough circle. One marking is white and one is light blue, but both are outlined in black. These markings form the \"eye\" of the swordfish. Along the edges of both shell halves are a series of white triangles with black outlines.\nAs the guardian of Poni Island, Tapu Fini can freely manipulate water and gains energy from ocean currents. To avoid harm to itself in battle, it shrouds its surroundings in a mysterious fog that sends its opponents into a self-destructive trance. The guardian also unleashes this fog as a test for those who seek the special water it can create, which is said to purify anything it touches. Many humans have attempted this trial, including those with ill intent; disgusted by this history, Tapu Fini does not care much for humans. Despite this, it is willing to help those who prove themselves worthy.[1] As shown in the anime, Tapu Fini has shown to be able to make water clocks out of water and bridge the world of the living with the world of the dead using mist. Long periods of exposure to this mist can trap people within it forever, specifically targeting those who cannot endure the pain of seeing a deceased loved one again.\nTapu Fini and the other guardian deities are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Nature's Madness.

The very center of its body is black both in front and back. The black space on the front contains its face, which consists of beady yellow eyes, circular blue cheeks, and a small mouth. The space on the back has only a single blue dot. There is a golden half-circlet on both the top and bottom half of its body, which divides it exactly in half. Two wispy extensions containing starry specks serve as its arms. Cosmog's gaseous body makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence.\nCosmog's body is frail and easily blown away. However, it is carefree and doesn't seem to mind. It collects dust from the atmosphere, which allows it to grow slowly. Cosmog has the ability to warp itself and those close to it, as well as open Ultra Wormholes, but only when under stress. This process is very dangerous for Cosmog, and the use of its powers can leave it immobile for extended periods of time. Cosmog is theorized by the Aether Foundation to be a type of Ultra Beast, and its name was coined by one of the professors at the Foundation. In ages past, it was known as the “child of the stars”. In behavior, Cosmog has an overly trusting nature and it immediately takes a liking to whoever shows it kindness, even when that person doesn't have the best intentions for it.[1] Cosmog is known to be very curious but not very cautious, this behavior has often lead to Cosmog being willing to put itself in danger, only to teleport away in case things get dicey.

The wavy rim of the bell flares outward and is bright blue. Its tentacles appear gelatinous and give it a vaguely humanoid shape. Several tentacles mesh together forming the appearance of a cape or long hair, while four shorter tentacles resemble shorter hair and arms. Two long tentacles make up the legs of the human shape. In addition to its shape, it is sometimes seen acting like a young girl. According to its concept art, Nihilego's body is made of various types of glass.\nNihilego is a parasitic organism and, by latching onto one's head, is capable of injecting a neurotoxin that subtly alters the thoughts and actions of any human or Pokémon that becomes its host. This neurotoxin stimulates intense feelings of excitement while causing a loss of inhibitions, which acts to forcibly bring out any latent potential within the host while wearing away at their minds. Nihilego's exact levels of intelligence are unknown, but according to Wicke, the Aether Foundation's research suggests that it acts mainly on a self-preservation instinct.[1] In the anime, Nihilego are capable of creating illusions and seeing the memories of humans. The anime also showed that Nihilego can demonstrate emotions other than self-preservation and the ability to heal people.\n\n\nSpoiler warning: this article may contain major plot or ending details.\n\n Nihilego fused with LusamineAs shown with Lusamine, Nihilego is capable of physically merging with a host. In this \"merged\" state, the bell loses its stars, developing several iridescent spots across its surface. The host's body is visible within the bell with their legs dangling beneath it. Its eight tentacles become long and flattened and have numerous deep black spots with various colored diamond-shapes inside. Four of the tentacles are connected to the bell via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single larger spine that, in the anime, injects its toxins into the ground while sharp rocks grow below. While the anime shows that Nihilego can willingly end this merger and it may be disrupted in other ways as well, the lingering toxins and the shock of the separation can leave the host in critical condition, both physically and psychologically.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoilers end here.",

The black color is a result of impurities building up within it as a result of its deep slumber. The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the brain prism, which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white.[1] Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each.\nNecrozma can take control of Solgaleo or Lunala by fusing with them, dominating their bodies and minds to assume its Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma forms, respectively. Because Necrozma is forcibly absorbing the limitless energy produced by their light, Solgaleo and Lunala constantly glow in a similar manner to their Radiant Sun and Full Moon phases while fused. In both cases, the host's body is covered in parts of Necrozma's body, which is arranged like armor.\nDusk Mane Necrozma has armor around its paws, head, and sides. Necrozma's tail splits into two and attaches to the sides of Solgaleo's torso and its large claws extend from Solgaleo's back.

Using the armor on its chest, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light.[2]\nDawn Wings Necrozma has armor around its torso, head, and certain parts of its wings and tail. It also has a triangular helmet with the brain prism visible, as well as Lunala's own eyes visible as glowing pink lights. Necrozma's arms extend from the center of its chest. The armor surrounding its body has two large spikes jutting up from around its shoulders and four, glowing pink lights in the center. On its lower back are two thin, antennae-like growths extending downward. A structure similar to Necrozma's tail extends from the center of its back, and like its Dusk Mane form, can be used as a form of propulsion. There are eleven crystalline spikes attached around the body, four each on the wings, and three on Lunala's tail. These spines are capable of firing dark energy.[3]\nOnce it absorbs enough light, Necrozma can undergo a process called Ultra Burst to reclaim its true form: Ultra Necrozma, a colossal dragon of pure light energy. Its size makes it the tallest Psychic-type. The various pieces of Necrozma's crystalline body are rearranged as a sort of \"skeleton\" for the rest of Ultra Necrozma's body. These pieces take on a golden glow from the light but return to black without it. Its head is surrounded by several spikes and a pair of small wings, which causes it to resemble an eight-pointed star; there is also a small, lighter eight-pointed star on the back of its head. Its face is armored and has multicolored heterochromic eyes; the left eye is primarily red, while the right is mainly blue. It has two pairs of wings: one around its shoulders and one around its hips. While the wings themselves are made of light, the arm portions are made of its former legs and shoulders, respectively. Its former arms now cover its lower legs, and what was once its tail covers its chest. Finally, it has a long tail with a row of spikes along the top.\nUltra Necrozma's body temperature exceeds 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,540 degrees Celsius); anything that it touches will melt from the extreme heat. It can fire laser beams from every part of its body, and these lasers can reach over 18 miles away, burning through everything in their path.[4] As seen in the anime, when Necrozma uses up all its light, it enters into a deep slumber unless it absorbs more light.\nNecrozma originates from Ultra Space and is capable of opening and traveling through Ultra Wormholes. In Ultra Megalopolis, it is known as the \"Blinding One\" (Japanese: かがやきさま Radiant One). It once had the ability to give light, but lost this ability after being injured by ancestors of the Ultra Recon Squad in an attempt to steal its light; Professor Kukui and Lillie theorize that the Sparkling Stones used to perform Z-Moves are fragments of Necrozma's body that it lost upon this injury. Necrozma displays extremely violent behavior due to the constant, maddening pain it suffers in its incomplete state, as it searches for the light it requires to sustain itself and regain its original form, going so far as to steal light from other beings and places. This behavior caused it to be feared as a \"pillager of light\" in ancient Alola. When fused to either Solgaleo or Lunala, it becomes even more vicious to the point of going on an uncontrollable rampage. As a result, it brutally attacks anything it sees as a foe with either its claws or its lasers, which can cut through anything. When Necrozma absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned.\nNecrozma and its alternate forms have several signature moves:\nNecrozma is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Prismatic Laser and Photon Geyser.\nUltra Necrozma is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Light That Burns the Sky.\nDusk Mane Necrozma and Solgaleo are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Sunsteel Strike.\nThey are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Searing Sunraze Smash.\nDawn Wings Necrozma and Lunala are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Moongeist Beam.\nThey are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom.",

Around Magearna's head is a gear with seven teeth, although the gear does not cover its chin. It has two large, rabbit-like ears with gold rims; a tiny nose and mouth; and light red eyes with pinkish ovals in the center. In the centers of the ovals are white crosses, and thin gold wiring encircles each eye with two small prongs similar to eyelashes. The rabbit-like ears appear to be two halves of a large disc held together by a hinge at the top.\nMagearna's upper body is similar to a Poké Ball: it is divided into two light blue portions by a thick gray band. In the front center of the band is a circular depression that is half-blue and half-pink. Above and below the depression, in the light blue portions, is a yellow, diamond-shaped marking. On either side of its upper body is a large, spherical shoulder with thin upper arms that lead to large, claw-shaped forearms and slightly pointed hands. Its lower body is a much larger sphere that resembles a ball gown. There is a pair of golden, wavy lines on each side of this sphere, which is divided down the front and back by a gray line. In the back, there is a solid gold ring with a hole in the center at the bottom of this line. The front has a gold ring as well, but it is broken at the top and bottom and has a shield shape in the center. Metal plates similar to the ruffles of a dress adorn the bottom of its lower body. It has two pointed legs.\nMagearna was created by a scientist 500 years ago. The sphere in this Pokémon's chest is known as the Soul-Heart, and the scientist created it by collecting life energy from Pokémon. The Soul-Heart is the true body of Magearna. Due to its ability to feel other's pain, it will try as hard as it can to save injured Pokémon. It can even perceive the emotions, thoughts, or feelings of other Pokémon as well. Whenever it is sleeping or sometimes when it is sad, Magearna can take on the appearance of a Poké Ball.[1]\nBack when it was invented, Magearna's body was primarily painted gold, though a lighter shade than the highlights and rims that adorn its body. The ears and the top half of its lower body were painted red, matching the coloration of an ordinary Poké Ball. This vivid coloring is a sign that it was a present to royalty. The princess of the land was very pleased with it.\nMagearna is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fleur Cannon.",

It also has a fur collar that covers its neck and mouth like a balaclava, while its belly has tufts that are similar in appearance and function to jacket pockets. Raboot's fur protects it from the cold, and allows it to use hotter fire moves, which it delivers through the yellow marks on its forehead and soles.[1] Raboot also has long ears, a few tufts of fur on top of its head, red irises, and a small yellow nose.\nRaboot usually practices its footwork by kicking Berries from a tree's branches and then juggling them with its feet. While training its kicking attacks, Raboot tries to avoid using its arms, tucking them under its fur. This effectively prevents Raboot from losing body heat.[1]\nRaboot and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon that can have Libero as an Ability.",

Its white eyes, which have red-orange irises, have a deep navy pattern below them and yellow eyebrows above them. These eyebrows connect at the nose, which is red-orange, and form a \"crown\", which connects to the red-orange tuft of hair sticking out from its forehead, similar to a flame. It has two whisker-like tufts of white fur on each side of its face. Over each shoulder is a navy patch of fur, resembling a shoulder brace, which continues down the torso and connect at middle of the chest, creating what resembles a sports tank top. This navy-colored fur is also seen on its lower torso, creating what resembles a belt. The fur on its lower body is colored red-orange and resembles a pair of pants, with yellow pockets and ending in yellow tufts at the knees, with little tufts of fur on the backside of its thighs. Its ankles and feet are colored navy-blue and tipped red-orange at the toes. On the underside of each foot, there are three yellow dots of fur, from which it fires flames when attacking opponents.\nBy juggling a pebble with its feet, Cinderace can transform it into a burning soccer ball. By putting a spin on the ball, it can launch attacks that its opponents struggle to evade. The shots it fires can leave an opponent scorched. Cinderace has great offensive and defensive capabilities, being one of the best at explosive force, jumping ability, and kicking power. Due to its strong core and great balance, Cinderace can unleash powerful kicks from any position. In battle, it uses artful footwork to feint and throw its opponents off.[1] Cinderace can get pumped up with excitement should it get cheered on. However, it may get itself in trouble if it starts showboating.\n Gigantamax Cinderace using G-Max Fireball.Cinderace is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Pyro Ball and Court Change. It and its pre-evolutions are also the only known Pokémon that can have Libero as an Ability, which allows them to change their types. As seen in the anime, the tuft of red hair on Cinderace's head changes in color when it changes its type.\nAs Gigantamax Cinderace, its body is generally larger with very few alterations, save for its ears which have become longer. It rides on a fireball enlarged by Gigantamax energy, sometimes exceeding 300 feet (90 meters) in size. The fireball has a white nose and eyes, as well as several wisps of fire resembling Cinderace's ears and crown-like eyebrows. Three red clouds float above Gigantamax Cinderace.\nGigantamax Cinderace is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Fireball; using its well-honed techniques and fighting spirit, it can make its fireball chase after opponents almost like it had a mind of its own, and thus this attack will never miss. Gigantamax Cinderace is said to have the strongest leg strength of any Pokémon. Without its giant Pyro Ball, it can still overwhelm even a Dynamax Pokémon by delivering powerful kicking moves.[2]",

It has a white diamond-shaped patch of skin on its stomach.\nInteleon has many hidden capabilities. It has darkly-colored nictitating membranes that allow it to analyze for an opponent's weak point. This helps it precisely shoot water from its fingertips at Mach 3. The membrane on its back is extendable, and allows it to glide in the air. It also has a sharp knife hidden in its tail.

A similar branching brown marking can be found running down the length of Barraskewda's dorsal side. It has two pairs of ventral fins and one dorsal fin located near the back of its body, along with four tail-fins that can rotate like a propeller, allowing Barraskewda to swim at high speeds. All of Barraskewda's fins are colored red. Its tail fins are attached to a white hub that connects to the brown rear section of its body, and the spines in its other fins are brown as well.\nBarraskewda's jaws are said to be as sharp as a spear and strong like steel. It propels itself up to speeds of 100 knots by spinning its tail, and uses that speed to ram into its prey, spearing it. It is able to leap out of the water and catch Wingull flying near the surface with its jaws. It is also known to compete with Finizen for food. The flesh of Barraskewda is surprisingly tasty.\nBarraskewda and its pre-evolution, Arrokuda, are the only known Pokémon that can have Propeller Tail as an Ability.",

Two additional electric spikes protrude from its back. It has four horns: two smaller ones above its eyes, and two larger ones on the sides of its head. Six organs protrude from its chest. Amped Form Toxtricity are known to be short-tempered and extremely confident. This form aggressively attacks anything that makes eye contact with it.[1]\nLow Key Form Toxtricity has an upright posture, with its neck standing tall.

It has a large fin-like horn in front of its face, and two smaller horns on the sides of its head. Its two light blue electric frills run from the base of its larger horn, and down to its neck. Four organs protrude from its chest. Low Key Form Toxtricity are known to be selfish and dismissive of others and have high regard towards their strength. Unlike its Amped Form counterpart, Low Key Form Toxtricity prefers to taunt opponents into fighting it when making eye contact with them.[2]\nBy clawing at the organs on their chests, both forms of Toxtricity can generate over 15,000 volts of electricity, as well as sound. The sounds they make resemble those of electric string instruments: a standard guitar for Amped Form, and a bass guitar for Low Key Form.

It has a dark purple body with a dark pink underbelly and dark pink accents on its back, soles, and hind legs. Its spikes and the crescent-shaped body part on its waist turn bright pink, and from its waist grows a tail resembling a transmission tower, and two protrusions that resemble conductor coils.

The ectoplasm causes anyone who touches it to become stiff like stone. Cursola can be seen wobbling while wandering, possibly because it enjoys being so light-weight. Cursola are known to gather together under a full moon, and send their branches into the sky. The reason for this behavior is unknown — one hypothesis suggests that it is a ritual of release, shedding the energy they've gathered from others; while another hypothesis posits that this is a form of communication between the Cursola.[1]\nCursola is the only known Pokémon that can have Perish Body as an Ability.",

An Alcremie's flavor affects the color of its body, which can be any of several pastel shades. Its eye color matches the color of its sweet. There are nine known flavors of Alcremie.\nWhen a Trainer gains Alcremie's trust, Alcremie will treat them to Berries with cream.

Its main body and tail are long, thin, and resemble a spinal column, and it has four small, thin limbs ending in claws formed from spindly appendages attached at right angles. Its torso is formed from a cage of appendages resembling ribs, and inside is a glowing pink core that serves as Eternatus's energy source, absorbing energy to sustain it. The core can also project its absorbed energy into massive blasts when using Dynamax Cannon, one of its signature moves. Its head is triangular in shape and has a pair of white, eye-like markings in the form of three connected circles, as well as a spindly lower jaw with several diamond-shaped teeth. Over its head is a translucent red film held between five long spikes extending toward its body's rear. It also has a pair of thin tendrils extending from its back, formed from numerous triangular segments. Eternatus's gigantic size makes it the tallest known Pokémon to ever exist.\nIf Eternatus absorbs a massive amount of energy at once, it will enter its Eternamax form, which is said to be its true appearance and is far larger in size. Eternatus will also briefly enter this form when using Eternabeam, another one of its signature moves. In this form, Eternatus's shape drastically changes. Its body becomes incredibly long and serpentine with most of its body forming a massive coil. Its entire body glows red in this form, and present at regular intervals across its length are black rings with spikes extending outward. Its back tendrils now curl around its main body. Its energy core rests at the center of the coil inside a cage of violet spikes. Eternatus's head takes on the form of a giant hand, with its fingers covered in black armor with spikes extending from the back of each segment. At the tip of each finger is a glowing pink eye.\nEternatus serves as the source of the Dynamax and Gigantamax phenomena in Galar due to its power leaking out in the form of Galar Particles following its defeat thousands of years ago by Zacian and Zamazenta. Pieces of its body imbued with its power rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. When it is awake, Eternatus causes a phenomenon dubbed the Darkest Day, in which the massive quantities of Dynamax energy it unleashes causes Pokémon to Dynamax and rampage uncontrollably. It can also sometimes keep other Pokémon from Dynamaxing in its presence. Despite this connection to the phenomenon, it cannot be Dynamaxed itself, as its Eternamax form replaces that effect. Eternatus has been referred to as the Darkest Day.\nAs seen in the anime, Eternatus can use its energy core to target a Pokémon and force it to Dynamax or Gigantamax. The anime also elaborates upon its ability to block other Pokémon from Dynamaxing, depicting this power as Eternatus absorbing the Galar Particles in the area to make them unavailable for other Pokémon to use. It is also shown to be capable of forcibly reverting other Pokémon that have already Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed through the same process. According to Rose in the anime, he was the one to have coined Eternatus’s name.\nIn its Eternamax form, Eternatus's power grows so immense that it causes a great storm of Dynamax energy around it, ripping holes in spacetime in the midst of the storm as it releases a virtually infinite amount of energy. Its tremendous power can even prevent opposing Pokémon from attacking it as it gathers energy.\nEternatus is an extraterrestrial Pokémon that came to Earth inside a meteor around 20,000 years ago.\nEternatus is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Dynamax Cannon and Eternabeam.

A ring of green spheres, marked with an inlaid series of blue and white triangles, adorns its neck. When it is in Ice Rider/Shadow Rider form using the Reins of Unity, the green fur on Calyrex's arms and back extends to resemble a white and green cape. The crown-like bud on Calyrex's head glows bright green when it is using its powers.\nCalyrex is said to have ruled Galar in ancient times as a merciful king. Despite its delicate and slight appearance, it can move with grace and dignity. It is known to be highly intelligent; Calyrex is one of the few Pokémon able to fluently understand and telepathically communicate the human language. It also has the power to see the past, present, and future of any kind when at full power.[1] One legend said Calyrex used its foresight ability to save creatures of a forest from a meteor one time. One fairy tale even mentions Calyrex stealing the body of a human that causes mischief. Calyrex has the ability to take control of a human's body in order to communicate and speak telepathically when at full power.\nIt has been referred to as the \"King of Bountiful Harvests\" due to its role in bringing lush vegetation and harvests yearly. Calyrex's right hand can cause the land to be covered in verdant grass and blooms, while its left hand allows it to make fields of fruit ripen and become heavy. Calyrex can create either Iceroot or Shaderoot Carrots, depending on the field where the Carrot Seeds are planted, with a special dance. Calyrex can also create the Radiant Petal needed for the Reins of Unity. It can provide healings or blessings such as mending the heart. While it shows no mercy to those that stand in its way, it will heal the wounds of a foe afterwards. Calyrex is powerful enough to move an entire forest and its Pokémon to a new location.\nCalyrex has the power to tame and combine with Glastrier or Spectrier when using the Reins of Unity. This allows Calyrex to be at its full power and potential. Calyrex also can heighten Glastrier's or Spectrier's power with its psychic energy. This in turn allowed Calyrex's psychic powers to manifest up to a 30-mile (50 km) radius. When riding either Glastrier or Spectrier, it ran all over Galar to bring green within the region's wastelands. Calyrex gets its powers from the faith of the people who worship it, and slowly loses its power if people start forgetting it and should Glastrier or Spectrier abandon it.\nBy combining with Glastrier, it can can emit a cold temperature up to −508 °F (−300 °C).[2] Glastrier's endurance also increases to the point it can run up to seven days and nights. This allows Ice Rider Calyrex to smash and freeze anything in its path no matter the difficulty of the road. Ice Rider Calyrex can use its psychic power to transform Glastrier's intense cold into gigantic icicles. It can use the icicles as other arrows to fire or lances for charging. The icicles are powerful enough to blow holes in rocky mountains and allows the duo pass through it completely.[3]\nWhen fused with Spectrier, it becomes swift to the point it can run a thousand miles within a single day. The strength of Spectrier's spectral power also increases. Shadow Rider Calyrex can infuse Spectrier with its psychic powers in order to create countless small will-o'-the-wisps. It uses the wisps to rain down on others like meteors before it steals the opponent's life-force with burning heat. It can also transform the steed's spectral aura into a black mass.

Second, the battle form where it stands on its hind legs in order to battle. Finally, the ride form which it assumes when humans ride on it. When Cyclizar is being ridden on, it puffs up its throat sac and curls its tail, making the appearance of wheels.\nCyclizar has a mild temperament. It has been kept by humans and used for transport since ancient times, with depictions of this behavior found in murals dating back 10,000 years ago. This relationship appears to be mutualistic, since the warmth of Cyclizar's rider helps it avoid getting cold, along with lifting its spirit. When carrying a human, Cyclizar can reach a speed of over 70 mph (120 km/h). Cyclizar maintains its balance and absorbs shock while running by using its hard head and thick yet supple tail. It also uses its head and tail to attack during battles.[1] Both Koraidon and Miraidon share a resemblance to Cyclizar, a detail noted by several NPCs in the game and their own Pokédex entries; it is later confirmed that they are ancient and futuristic versions of Cyclizar, respectively.",

On its back rests very large red wings that begin with a three-pronged yellow pattern on both sides, that then curl upward into a crescent moon-like shape which apparently gives the Pokémon its name, with blue-tipped feather-like protrusions on the ends. Below its wings is a jagged cape-like structure with a black underside.\nAccording to an article from an April issue of Occulture magazine, Roaring Moon is named after a similarly described being in the Scarlet Book. It looks similar to Salamence when they undergo Mega Evolution, but it's unclear if there is any connection. It's said that Roaring Moon scatters feathers as it flies around at high speeds seeking prey. It's thought to be more savage than Salamence and that it should be avoided at all costs.",

		"biology": "Iron Valiant is a mechanical, bipedal Pokémon whose appearance retains numerous visual traits from both Gardevoir and Gallade. Its arms consists of gauntlets with large magenta blades protruding from the sides, which it can detach and combine to serve as a deadly double-edged weapon. Its head spikes outward twice from both sides and is covered by a green curved piece resembling hair with two cone-shaped structures at the back of its head, and a teal head crest, somewhat akin to a gladiator's helmet. A magenta core serves as a centerpiece on its chest. Five petal-shaped white and green guards tinged with magenta at the ends adorn its torso, resembling a dress.\nAccording to an article from an April issue of Occulture magazine, Iron Valiant's name is borrowed from that of an object described in the Violet Book. An unproven theory claims that it is a robot built as the product of a mad scientist's efforts to create the most powerful psychic Pokémon. According to eyewitnesses, Iron Valiant is similar in appearance to both Gardevoir and Gallade. It is also said to be a cruel Pokémon, willing to take its shining blade and cut down anyone confronting it without hesitation.",

		"biology": "Apex Build Koraidon is a large reptilian Pokémon. Most of its body is scarlet in color, with white accents on its cheeks, abdomen, legs, and tail. Its head features a large plume and a pair of long, thin, twisted antennae; its rear has a similar, much larger plume. These plumes and antennae are white in color, and blue-purple at the base. It has yellow eyes with brown pupils, webbed feet, and blue features on its elbows and shoulders, as well as blue frills running down its neck. On its chest is a large circular protrusion which resembles a rubber tire. Its texture and black coloration is similar to the base of its tail, and it can inflate or deflate as needed.\nLimited Build Koraidon walks on all fours. The head and rear plumes are closed and folded. The chest throat is pulled in, leaving out the rubber tire-like protrusion. The membrane on all four legs is not visible as the central fingers and toes are kept in close contact with each other. Koraidon assumes this form either when weakened or not battling.\nKoraidon has the ability to change its form in order to facilitate travel. Sprinting Build Koraidon tucks in its tail and runs on all fours, moving at very fast speeds using its powerful legs. This form also allows Koraidon to climb cliffs. Swimming Build Koraidon can float in the water by turning its throat into a flotation device and using the membrane between its feet to swim. Gliding Build Koraidon can fly by unravelling its twisted tendrils into wings, allowing it to glide through the sky.[1]\nKoraidon was brought to the current era through a time machine created by Professor Sada but it is different from the other Paradox Pokémon. She was capable of only bringing two of them, and is also the one who coined Koraidon's name. According to the Scarlet Book, Koraidon is known as the Winged King and said to be a burlier and more ferocious ancestor of Cyclizar. It is powerful enough to break the land with just its bare fists.\nKoraidon is aware of its own impressive strength and derives confidence from this fact, never feeling threatened by its opponents. It is capricious and curious enough to sometimes play with humans, despite usually being cautious of them. While fighting in its Apex Build, Koraidon dominates its opponents using its immense strength and the many natural weapons available to it, including its tough jaws and fangs, sharp claws, and thick, powerful tail. Its legs are strong enough that Koraidon can leap over 65 feet into the air, using both its own body weight and the momentum of falling from such a height to unleash crushing kicks and brutal body slams.[2]\nKoraidon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Collision Course.\n\n\n\n\nLimited Build\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSprinting Build\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwimming Build\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGliding Build",

		"biology": "Ultimate Mode Miraidon is a large robotic reptilian Pokémon. Most of its body is violet in color, although its face, claws, abdomen, and tail are gray. Additionally, there are light blue accents on its shoulders and legs, the latter of which resemble jet engines when folded and allow it to float in the air. Its head has a dark purple casque, circular purple cheeks, two pairs of antennae, and black eyes. The eyes have a pixelated display; they usually show yellow-cyan pupils, although Miraidon can simulate blinking by changing the display pattern. Inside Miraidon's body is what appears to be purplish-yellow energy, with light blue streaks accenting it. This energy is mostly concentrated on its throat (forming a prominent circular growth), tail, and antennae (which can emit the energy in a manner similar to electricity).\nLow-Power Mode Miraidon walks on all fours, with the jet engine-like legs unfolding. The antennae become light sliver along with the throat. The eyes are light blue. The other glowing parts of its body become violet. Miraidon assumes this form either when weakened or not battling.\nMiraidon has the ability to change its form in order to facilitate travel. Drive Mode Miraidon can generate the energy in its tail and throat and turn them into wheel-like rings, which allow it to accelerate. Drive Mode Miraidon is capable of driving up cliffs. Aquatic Mode Miraidon is similar in appearance to Drive Mode and propels itself using both its rings and the jet engines on its legs. Glide Mode Miraidon moves its antennae in order to expand an energy membrane, allowing it to glide through the sky.[1]\nMiraidon was brought to the current era through a time machine created by Professor Turo but it is different from the other Paradox Pokémon. He was capable of only bringing two of them, and is also the one who coined Miraidon's name. According to the Violet Book, Miraidon is known as the Iron Serpent and is said to be much more ruthless and powerful than its ancestor Cyclizar. It is powerful enough to use its lightning to turn the land into ash.\nWhile apparently accustomed to humans, Miraidon uses its power of insight and observation to carefully judge a person's character before it decides whether to join them or not. It has a calm and collected disposition, and it is very difficult for others to tell what it is thinking or feeling due to its robotic nature, with the only available hints presented in its eyes. In its Ultimate Mode, it keeps itself afloat to maintain an advantageous position that applies pressure to grounded opponents, and it anticipates their moves before striking at their weak points. It uses the electricity generated in its internal organs to charge its claws, fangs, and tail. One strike from its charged tail is said to knock out even the sturdiest foe.[2]\nMiraidon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Electro Drift.\n\n\n\n\nLow-Power Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAquatic Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlide Mode",
